chapter 97 the lamp  had you descended from the pequod s try works to the pequod s forecastle where the off duty watch were sleeping for one single moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors there they lay in their triangular oaken vaults each mariner a chiselled muteness a score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes  in merchantmen oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queens to dress in the dark and eat in the dark and stumble in darkness to his pallet this is his usual lot but the whaleman as he seeks the food of light so he lives in light he makes his berth an aladdin s lamp and lays him down in it so that in the pitchiest night the ship s black hull still houses an illumination  see with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of lamps often but old bottles and vials though to the copper cooler at the try works and replenishes them there as mugs of ale at a vat he burns too the purest of oil in its unmanufactured and therefore unvitiated state a fluid unknown to solar lunar or astral contrivances ashore it is sweet as early grass butter in april he goes and hunts for his oil so as to be sure of its freshness and genuineness even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own supper of game
