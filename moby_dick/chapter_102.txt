chapter 99 the doubloon  ere now it has been related how ahab was wont to pace his quarter deck taking regular turns at either limit the binnacle and mainmast but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been added how that sometimes in these walks when most plunged in his mood he was wont to pause in turn at each spot and stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him when he halted before the binnacle with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpose and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast then as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness only dashed with a certain wild longing if not hopefulness  but one morning turning to pass the doubloon he seemed to be newly attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it as though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them and some certain significance lurks in all things else all things are little worth and the round world itself but an empty cipher except to sell by the cartload as they do hills about boston to fill up some morass in the milky way  now this doubloon was of purest virgin gold raked somewhere out of the heart of gorgeous hills whence east and west over golden sands the head waters of many a pactolus flows and though now nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes yet untouchable and immaculate to any foulness it still preserved its quito glow nor though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last for it was set apart and sanctified to one awe striking end and however wanton in their sailor ways one and all the mariners revered it as the white whale s talisman sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night wondering whose it was to be at last and whether he would ever live to spend it  now those noble golden coins of south america are as medals of the sun and tropic token pieces here palms alpacas and volcanoes sun s disks and stars ecliptics horns of plenty and rich banners waving are in luxuriant profusion stamped so that the precious gold seems almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories by passing through those fancy mints so spanishly poetic  it so chanced that the doubloon of the pequod was a most wealthy example of these things on its round border it bore the letters republica del ecuador quito so this bright coin came from a country planted in the middle of the world and beneath the great equator and named after it and it had been cast midway up the andes in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three andes summits from one a flame a tower on another on the third a crowing cock while arching over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac the signs all marked with their usual cabalistics and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at libra  before this equatorial coin ahab not unobserved by others was now pausing  there s something ever egotistical in mountain tops and towers and all other grand and lofty things look here three peaks as proud as lucifer the firm tower that is ahab the volcano that is ahab the courageous the undaunted and victorious fowl that too is ahab all are ahab and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe which like a magician s glass to each and every man in turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self great pains small gains for those who ask the world to solve them it cannot solve itself methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face but see aye he enters the sign of storms the equinox and but six months before he wheeled out of a former equinox at aries from storm to storm so be it then born in throes tis fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs so be it then here s stout stuff for woe to work on so be it then  no fairy fingers can have pressed the gold but devil s claws must have left their mouldings there since yesterday murmured starbuck to himself leaning against the bulwarks the old man seems to read belshazzar s awful writing i have never marked the coin inspectingly he goes below let me read a dark valley between three mighty heaven abiding peaks that almost seem the trinity in some faint earthly symbol so in this vale of death god girds us round and over all our gloom the sun of righteousness still shines a beacon and a hope if we bend down our eyes the dark vale shows her mouldy soil but if we lift them the bright sun meets our glance half way to cheer yet oh the great sun is no fixture and if at midnight we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him we gaze for him in vain this coin speaks wisely mildly truly but still sadly to me i will quit it lest truth shake me falsely  there now s the old mogul soliloquized stubb by the try works he s been twigging it and there goes starbuck from the same and both with faces which i should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long and all from looking at a piece of gold which did i have it now on negro hill or in corlaer s hook i d not look at it very long ere spending it humph in my poor insignificant opinion i regard this as queer i have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings your doubloons of old spain your doubloons of peru your doubloons of chili your doubloons of bolivia your doubloons of popayan with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles and joes and half joes and quarter joes what then should there be in this doubloon of the equator that is so killing wonderful by golconda let me read it once halloa here s signs and wonders truly that now is what old bowditch in his epitome calls the zodiac and what my almanac below calls ditto i ll get the almanac and as i have heard devils can be raised with daboll s arithmetic i ll try my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the massachusetts calendar here s the book let s see now signs and wonders and the sun he s always among em hem hem hem here they are here they go all alive aries or the ram taurus or the bull and jimimi here s gemini himself or the twins well the sun he wheels among em aye here on the coin he s just crossing the threshold between two of twelve sitting rooms all in a ring book you lie there the fact is you books must know your places you ll do to give us the bare words and facts but we come in to supply the thoughts that s my small experience so far as the massachusetts calendar and bowditch s navigator and daboll s arithmetic go signs and wonders eh pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs and significant in wonders there s a clue somewhere wait a bit hist hark by jove i have it look you doubloon your zodiac here is the life of man in one round
