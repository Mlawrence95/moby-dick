chapter and now i ll read it off straight out of the book come almanack to begin there s aries or the ram lecherous dog he begets us then taurus or the bull he bumps us the first thing then gemini or the twins that is virtue and vice we try to reach virtue when lo comes cancer the crab and drags us back and here going from virtue leo a roaring lion lies in the path he gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw we escape and hail virgo the virgin that s our first love we marry and think to be happy for aye when pop comes libra or the scales happiness weighed and found wanting and while we are very sad about that lord how we suddenly jump as scorpio or the scorpion stings us in the rear we are curing the wound when whang come the arrows all round sagittarius or the archer is amusing himself as we pluck out the shafts stand aside here s the battering ram capricornus or the goat full tilt he comes rushing and headlong we are tossed when aquarius or the water bearer pours out his whole deluge and drowns us and to wind up with pisces or the fishes we sleep there s a sermon now writ in high heaven and the sun goes through it every year and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty jollily he aloft there wheels through toil and trouble and so alow here does jolly stubb oh jolly s the word for aye adieu doubloon but stop here comes little king post dodge round the try works now and let s hear what he ll have to say there he s before it he ll out with something presently so so he s beginning  i see nothing here but a round thing made of gold and whoever raises a certain whale this round thing belongs to him so what s all this staring been about it is worth sixteen dollars that s true and at two cents the cigar that s nine hundred and sixty cigars i won t smoke dirty pipes like stubb but i like cigars and here s nine hundred and sixty of them so here goes flask aloft to spy em out  shall i call that wise or foolish now if it be really wise it has a foolish look to it yet if it be really foolish then has it a sort of wiseish look to it but avast here comes our old manxman the old hearse driver he must have been that is before he took to the sea he luffs up before the doubloon halloa and goes round on the other side of the mast why there s a horse shoe nailed on that side and now he s back again what does that mean hark he s muttering voice like an old worn out coffee mill prick ears and listen  if the white whale be raised it must be in a month and a day when the sun stands in some one of these signs i ve studied signs and know their marks they were taught me two score years ago by the old witch in copenhagen now in what sign will the sun then be the horse shoe sign for there it is right opposite the gold and what s the horse shoe sign the lion is the horse shoe sign the roaring and devouring lion ship old ship my old head shakes to think of thee  there s another rendering now but still one text all sorts of men in one kind of world you see dodge again here comes queequeg all tattooing looks like the signs of the zodiac himself what says the cannibal as i live he s comparing notes looking at his thigh bone thinks the sun is in the thigh or in the calf or in the bowels i suppose as the old women talk surgeon s astronomy in the back country and by jove he s found something there in the vicinity of his thigh i guess it s sagittarius or the archer no he don t know what to make of the doubloon he takes it for an old button off some king s trowsers but aside again here comes that ghost devil fedallah tail coiled out of sight as usual oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual what does he say with that look of his ah only makes a sign to the sign and bows himself there is a sun on the coin fire worshipper depend upon it ho more and more this way comes pip poor boy would he had died or i he s half horrible to me he too has been watching all of these interpreters myself included and look now he comes to read with that unearthly idiot face stand away again and hear him hark  i look you look he looks we look ye look they look  upon my soul he s been studying murray s grammar improving his mind poor fellow but

unscrew it but unscrew your navel and what s the consequence then again if it stays here that is ugly too for when aught s nailed to the mast it s a sign that things grow desperate ha ha old ahab the white whale he ll nail ye this is a pine tree my father in old tolland county cut down a pine tree once and found a silver ring grown over in it some old darkey s wedding ring how did it get there and
