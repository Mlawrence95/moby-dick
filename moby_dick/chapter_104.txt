chapter 100 leg and arm  the pequod of nantucket meets the samuel enderby of london  ship ahoy hast seen the white whale  so cried ahab once more hailing a ship showing english colours bearing down under the stern trumpet to mouth the old man was standing in his hoisted quarter boat his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger captain who was carelessly reclining in his own boat s bow he was a darkly tanned burly good natured fine looking man of sixty or thereabouts dressed in a spacious roundabout that hung round him in festoons of blue pilot cloth and one empty arm of this jacket streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar s surcoat  hast seen the white whale  see you this and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone terminating in a wooden head like a mallet  man my boat cried ahab impetuously and tossing about the oars near him stand by to lower  in less than a minute without quitting his little craft he and his crew were dropped to the water and were soon alongside of the stranger but here a curious difficulty presented itself in the excitement of the moment ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the pequod and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment s warning now it is no very easy matter for anybody except those who are almost hourly used to it like whalemen to clamber up a ship s side from a boat on the open sea for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson so deprived of one leg and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain  it has before been hinted perhaps that every little untoward circumstance that befell him and which indirectly sprang from his luckless mishap almost invariably irritated or exasperated ahab and in the present instance all this was heightened by the sight of the two officers of the strange ship leaning over the side by the perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there and swinging towards him a pair of tastefully ornamented man ropes for at first they did not seem to bethink them that a one legged man must be too much of a cripple to use their sea bannisters but this awkwardness only lasted a minute because the strange captain observing at a glance how affairs stood cried out i see i see avast heaving there jump boys and swing over the cutting tackle  as good luck would have it they had had a whale alongside a day or two previous and the great tackles were still aloft and the massive curved blubber hook now clean and dry was still attached to the end this was quickly lowered to ahab who at once comprehending it all slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook it was like sitting in the fluke of an anchor or the crotch of an apple tree and then giving the word held himself fast and at the same time also helped to hoist his own weight by pulling hand over hand upon one of the running parts of the tackle soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks and gently landed upon the capstan head with his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome the other captain advanced and ahab putting out his ivory leg and crossing the ivory arm like two sword fish blades cried out in his walrus way aye aye hearty let us shake bones together an arm and a leg an arm that never can shrink d ye see and a leg that never can run where did st thou see the white whale how long ago  the white whale said the englishman pointing his ivory arm towards the east and taking a rueful sight along it as if it had been a telescope there i saw him on the line last season  and he took that arm off did he asked ahab now sliding down from the capstan and resting on the englishman s shoulder as he did so  aye he was the cause of it at least and that leg too  spin me the yarn said ahab how was it  it was the first time in my life that i ever cruised on the line began the englishman i was ignorant of the white whale at that time well one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales and my boat fastened to one of them a regular circus horse he was too that went milling and milling round so that my boat s crew could only trim dish by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale with a milky white head and hump all crows feet and wrinkles  it was he it was he cried ahab suddenly letting out his suspended breath  and harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin  aye aye they were mine _my_ irons cried ahab exultingly but on  give me a chance then said the englishman good humoredly well this old great grandfather with the white head and hump runs all afoam into the pod and goes to snapping furiously at my fast line  aye i see wanted to part it free the fast fish an old trick i know him  how it was exactly continued the one armed commander i do not know but in biting the line it got foul of his teeth caught there somehow but we didn t know it then so that when we afterwards pulled on the line bounce we came plump on to his hump instead of the other whale s that went off to windward all fluking seeing how matters stood and what a noble great whale it was the noblest and biggest i ever saw sir in my life i resolved to capture him spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in and thinking the hap hazard line would get loose or the tooth it was tangled to might draw for i have a devil of a boat s crew for a pull on a whale line seeing all this i say i jumped into my first mate s boat mr mounttop s here by the way captain mounttop mounttop the captain as i was saying i jumped into mounttop s boat which d ye see was gunwale and gunwale with mine then and snatching the first harpoon let this old great grandfather have it but lord look you sir hearts and souls alive man the next instant in a jiff i was blind as a bat both eyes out all befogged and bedeadened with black foam the whale s tail looming straight up out of it perpendicular in the air like a marble steeple no use sterning all then but as i was groping at midday with a blinding sun all crown jewels as i was groping i say after the second iron to toss it overboard down comes the tail like a lima tower cutting my boat in two leaving each half in splinters and flukes first the white hump backed through the wreck as though it was all chips we all struck out to escape his terrible flailings i seized hold of my harpoon pole sticking in him and for a moment clung to that like a sucking fish but a combing sea dashed me off and at the same instant the fish taking one good dart forwards went down like a flash and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me caught me here clapping his hand just below his shoulder yes caught me just here i say and bore me down to hell s flames i was thinking when when all of a sudden thank the good god the barb ript its way along the flesh clear along the whole length of my arm came out nigh my wrist and up i floated and that gentleman there will tell you the rest by the way captain dr bunger ship s surgeon bunger my lad the captain now bunger boy spin your part of the yarn  the professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out had been all the time standing near them with nothing specific visible to denote his gentlemanly rank on board his face was an exceedingly round but sober one he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt and patched trowsers and had thus far been dividing his attention between a marlingspike he held in one hand and a pill box held in the other occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two crippled captains but at his superior s introduction of him to ahab he politely bowed and straightway went on to do his captain s bidding  it was a shocking bad wound began the whale surgeon and taking my advice captain boomer here stood our old sammy  samuel enderby is the name of my ship interrupted the one armed captain addressing ahab go on boy  stood our old sammy off to the northward to get out of the blazing hot weather there on the line but it was no use i did all i could sat up with him nights was very severe with him in the matter of diet  oh very severe chimed in the patient himself then suddenly altering his voice drinking hot rum toddies with me every night till he couldn t see to put on the bandages and sending me to bed half seas over about three o clock in the morning oh ye stars he sat up with me indeed and was very severe in my diet oh a great watcher and very dietetically severe is dr bunger bunger you dog laugh out why don t ye you know you re a precious jolly rascal but heave ahead boy i d rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man  my captain you must have ere this perceived respected sir said the imperturbable godly looking bunger slightly bowing to ahab is apt to be facetious at times he spins us many clever things of that sort but i may as well say en passant as the french remark that i myself that is to say jack bunger late of the reverend clergy am a strict total abstinence man i never drink  water cried the captain he never drinks it it s a sort of fits to him fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia but go on go on with the arm story  yes i may as well said the surgeon coolly i was about observing sir before captain boomer s facetious interruption that spite of my best and severest endeavors the wound kept getting worse and worse the truth was sir it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw more than two feet and several inches long i measured it with the lead line in short it grew black i knew what was threatened and off it came but i had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there that thing is against all rule pointing at it with the marlingspike that is the captain s work not mine he ordered the carpenter to make it he had that club hammer there put to the end to knock some one s brains out with i suppose as he tried mine once he flies into diabolical passions sometimes do ye see this dent sir removing his hat and brushing aside his hair and exposing a bowl like cavity in his skull but which bore not the slightest scarry trace or any token of ever having been a wound well the captain there will tell you how that came here he knows  no i don t said the captain but his mother did he was born with it oh you solemn rogue you you bunger was there ever such another bunger in the watery world bunger when you die you ought to die in pickle you dog you should be preserved to future ages you rascal  what became of the white whale now cried ahab who thus far had been impatiently listening to this by play between the two englishmen  oh cried the one armed captain oh yes well after he sounded we didn t see him again for some time in fact as i before hinted i didn t then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick till some time afterwards when coming back to the line we heard about moby dick as some call him and then i knew it was he  did st thou cross his wake again  twice  but could not fasten  didn t want to try to ain t one limb enough what should i do without this other arm and i m thinking moby dick doesn t bite so much as he swallows  well then interrupted bunger give him your left arm for bait to get the right do you know gentlemen very gravely and mathematically bowing to each captain in succession do you know gentlemen that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by divine providence that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest even a man s arm and he knows it too so that what you take for the white whale s malice is only his awkwardness for he never means to swallow a single limb he only thinks to terrify by feints but sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow formerly a patient of mine in ceylon that making believe swallow jack knives once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more when i gave him an emetic and he heaved it up in small tacks d ye see no possible way for him to digest that jack knife and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system yes captain boomer if you are quick enough about it and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other why in that case the arm is yours only let the whale have another chance at you shortly that s all  no thank ye bunger said the english captain he s welcome to the arm he has since i can t help it and didn t know him then but not to another one no more white whales for me i ve lowered for him once and that has satisfied me there would be great glory in killing him i know that and there is a ship load of precious sperm in him but hark ye he s best let alone don t you think so captain glancing at the ivory leg  he is but he will still be hunted for all that what is best let alone that accursed thing is not always what least allures he s all a magnet how long since thou saw st him last which way heading  bless my soul and curse the foul fiend s cried bunger stoopingly walking round ahab and like a dog strangely snuffing this man s blood bring the thermometer it s at the boiling point his pulse makes these planks beat sir taking a lancet from his pocket and drawing near to ahab s arm  avast roared ahab dashing him against the bulwarks man the boat which way heading  good god cried the english captain to whom the question was put what s the matter he was heading east i think is your captain crazy whispering fedallah  but fedallah putting a finger on his lip slid over the bulwarks to take the boat s steering oar and ahab swinging the cutting tackle towards him commanded the ship s sailors to stand by to lower  in a moment he was standing in the boat s stern and the manilla men were springing to their oars in vain the english captain hailed him with back to the stranger ship and face set like a flint to his own ahab stood upright till alongside of the pequod
