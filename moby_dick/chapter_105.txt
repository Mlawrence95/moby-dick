chapter 101 the decanter  ere the english ship fades from sight be it set down here that she hailed from london and was named after the late samuel enderby merchant of that city the original of the famous whaling house of enderby sons a house which in my poor whaleman s opinion comes not far behind the united royal houses of the tudors and bourbons in point of real historical interest how long prior to the year of our lord 1775 this great whaling house was in existence my numerous fish documents do not make plain but in that year 1775 it fitted out the first english ships that ever regularly hunted the sperm whale though for some score of years previous ever since 1726 our valiant coffins and maceys of nantucket and the vineyard had in large fleets pursued that leviathan but only in the north and south atlantic not elsewhere be it distinctly recorded here that the nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great sperm whale and that for half a century they were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him  in 1778 a fine ship the amelia fitted out for the express purpose and at the sole charge of the vigorous enderbys boldly rounded cape horn and was the first among the nations to lower a whale boat of any sort in the great south sea the voyage was a skilful and lucky one and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm the amelia s example was soon followed by other ships english and american and thus the vast sperm whale grounds of the pacific were thrown open but not content with this good deed the indefatigable house again bestirred itself samuel and all his sons how many their mother only knows and under their immediate auspices and partly i think at their expense the british government was induced to send the sloop of war rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the south sea commanded by a naval post captain the rattler made a rattling voyage of it and did some service how much does not appear but this is not all in 1819 the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of japan that ship well called the syren made a noble experimental cruise and it was thus that the great japanese whaling ground first became generally known the syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a captain coffin a nantucketer  all honor to the enderbies therefore whose house i think exists to the present day though doubtless the original samuel must long ago have slipped his cable for the great south sea of the other world  the ship named after him was worthy of the honor being a very fast sailer and a noble craft every way i boarded her once at midnight somewhere off the patagonian coast and drank good flip down in the forecastle it was a fine gam we had and they were all trumps every soul on board a short life to them and a jolly death and that fine gam i had long very long after old ahab touched her planks with his ivory heel it minds me of the noble solid saxon hospitality of that ship and may my parson forget me and the devil remember me if i ever lose sight of it flip did i say we had flip yes and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallons the hour and when the squall came for it s squally off there by patagonia and all hands visitors and all were called to reef topsails we were so top heavy that we had to swing each other aloft in bowlines and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets into the sails so that we hung there reefed fast in the howling gale a warning example to all drunken tars however the masts did not go overboard and by and by we scrambled down so sober that we had to pass the flip again though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle scuttle rather too much diluted and pickled it to my taste  the beef was fine tough but with body in it they said it was bull beef others that it was dromedary beef but i do not know for certain how that was they had dumplings too small but substantial symmetrically globular and indestructible dumplings i fancied that you could feel them and roll them about in you after they were swallowed if you stooped over too far forward you risked their pitching out of you like billiard balls the bread but that couldn t be helped besides it was an anti scorbutic in short the bread contained the only fresh fare they had but the forecastle was not very light and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it but all in all taking her from truck to helm considering the dimensions of the cook s boilers including his own live parchment boilers fore and aft i say the samuel enderby was a jolly ship of good fare and plenty fine flip and strong crack fellows all and capital from boot heels to hat band  but why was it think ye that the samuel enderby and some other english whalers i know of not all though were such famous hospitable ships that passed round the beef and the bread and the can and the joke and were not soon weary of eating and drinking and laughing i will tell you the abounding good cheer of these english whalers is matter for historical research nor have i been at all sparing of historical whale research when it has seemed needed  the english were preceded in the whale fishery by the hollanders zealanders and danes from whom they derived many terms still extant in the fishery and what is yet more their fat old fashions touching plenty to eat and drink for as a general thing the english merchant ship scrimps her crew but not so the english whaler hence in the english this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural but incidental and particular and therefore must have some special origin which is here pointed out and will be still further elucidated  during my researches in the leviathanic histories i stumbled upon an ancient dutch volume which by the musty whaling smell of it i knew must be about whalers the title was dan coopman wherefore i concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some amsterdam cooper in the fishery as every whale ship must carry its cooper i was reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one fitz swackhammer but my friend dr snodhead a very learned man professor of low dutch and high german in the college of santa claus and st pott s to whom i handed the work for translation giving him a box of sperm candles for his trouble this same dr snodhead so soon as he spied the book assured me that dan coopman did not mean the cooper but the merchant in short this ancient and learned low dutch book treated of the commerce of holland and among other subjects contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery and in this chapter it was headed smeer or fat that i found a long detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of 180 sail of dutch whalemen from which list as translated by dr snodhead i transcribe the following  400 000 lbs of beef 60 000 lbs friesland pork 150 000 lbs of stock fish 550 000 lbs of biscuit 72 000 lbs of soft bread 2 800 firkins of butter 20 000 lbs texel leyden cheese 144 000 lbs cheese probably an inferior article 550 ankers of geneva 10 800 barrels of beer  most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading not so in the present case however where the reader is flooded with whole pipes barrels quarts and gills of good gin and good cheer  at the time i devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this beer beef and bread during which many profound thoughts were incidentally suggested to me capable of a transcendental and platonic application and furthermore i compiled supplementary tables of my own touching the probable quantity of stock fish etc consumed by every low dutch harpooneer in that ancient greenland and spitzbergen whale fishery in the first place the amount of butter and texel and leyden cheese consumed seems amazing i impute it though to their naturally unctuous natures being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their vocation and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid polar seas on the very coasts of that esquimaux country where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil  the quantity of beer too is very large 10 800 barrels now as those polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that climate so that the whole cruise of one of these dutch whalemen including the short voyage to and from the spitzbergen sea did not much exceed three months say and reckoning 30 men to each of their fleet of 180 sail we have 5 400 low dutch seamen in all therefore i say we have precisely two barrels of beer per man for a twelve weeks allowance exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin now whether these gin and beer harpooneers so fuddled as one might fancy them to have been were the right sort of men to stand up in a boat s head and take good aim at flying whales this would seem somewhat improbable yet they did aim at them and hit them too but this was very far north be it remembered where beer agrees well with the constitution upon the equator in our southern fishery beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast head and boozy in his boat and grievous loss might ensue to nantucket and new bedford  but no more enough has been said to show that the old dutch whalers of two or three centuries ago were high livers and that the english whalers have not neglected so excellent an example for say they when cruising in an empty ship if you can get nothing better out of the world get a good dinner out of it at least and this empties the decanter
