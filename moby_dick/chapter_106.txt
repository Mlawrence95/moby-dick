chapter 102 a bower in the arsacides  hitherto in descriptively treating of the sperm whale i have chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect or separately and in detail upon some few interior structural features but to a large and thorough sweeping comprehension of him it behooves me now to unbutton him still further and untagging the points of his hose unbuckling his garters and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones set him before you in his ultimatum that is to say in his unconditional skeleton  but how now ishmael how is it that you a mere oarsman in the fishery pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale did erudite stubb mounted upon your capstan deliver lectures on the anatomy of the cetacea and by help of the windlass hold up a specimen rib for exhibition explain thyself ishmael can you land a full grown whale on your deck for examination as a cook dishes a roast pig surely not a veritable witness have you hitherto been ishmael but have a care how you seize the privilege of jonah alone the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams the rafters ridge pole sleepers and under pinnings making up the frame work of leviathan and belike of the tallow vats dairy rooms butteries and cheeseries in his bowels  i confess that since jonah few whalemen have penetrated very far beneath the skin of the adult whale nevertheless i have been blessed with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature in a ship i belonged to a small cub sperm whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons and for the heads of the lances think you i let that chance go without using my boat hatchet and jack knife and breaking the seal and reading all the contents of that young cub  and as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their gigantic full grown development for that rare knowledge i am indebted to my late royal friend tranquo king of tranque one of the arsacides for being at tranque years ago when attached to the trading ship dey of algiers i was invited to spend part of the arsacidean holidays with the lord of tranque at his retired palm villa at pupella a sea side glen not very far distant from what our sailors called bamboo town his capital  among many other fine qualities my royal friend tranquo being gifted with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu had brought together in pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his people could invent chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices chiselled shells inlaid spears costly paddles aromatic canoes and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders the wonder freighted tribute rendering waves had cast upon his shores  chief among these latter was a great sperm whale which after an unusually long raging gale had been found dead and stranded with his head against a cocoa nut tree whose plumage like tufted droopings seemed his verdant jet when the vast body had at last been stripped of its fathom deep enfoldings and the bones become dust dry in the sun then the skeleton was carefully transported up the pupella glen where a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it  the ribs were hung with trophies the vertebr√¶ were carved with arsacidean annals in strange hieroglyphics in the skull the priests kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame so that the mystic head again sent forth its vapory spout while suspended from a bough the terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees like the hair hung sword that so affrighted damocles  it was a wondrous sight the wood was green as mosses of the icy glen the trees stood high and haughty feeling their living sap the industrious earth beneath was as a weaver s loom with a gorgeous carpet on it whereof the ground vine tendrils formed the warp and woof and the living flowers the figures all the trees with all their laden branches all the shrubs and ferns and grasses the message carrying air all these unceasingly were active through the lacings of the leaves the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure oh busy weaver unseen weaver pause one word whither flows the fabric what palace may it deck wherefore all these ceaseless toilings speak weaver stay thy hand but one single word with thee nay the shuttle flies the figures float from forth the loom the freshet rushing carpet for ever slides away the weaver god he weaves and by that weaving is he deafened that he hears no mortal voice and by that humming we too who look on the loom are deafened and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it for even so it is in all material factories the spoken words that are inaudible among the flying spindles those same words are plainly heard without the walls bursting from the opened casements thereby have villainies been detected ah mortal then be heedful for so in all this din of the great world s loom thy subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar  now amid the green life restless loom of that arsacidean wood the great white worshipped skeleton lay lounging a gigantic idler yet as the ever woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around him the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver himself all woven over with the vines every month assuming greener fresher verdure but himself a skeleton life folded death death trellised life the grim god wived with youthful life and begat him curly headed glories  now when with royal tranquo i visited this wondrous whale and saw the skull an altar and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet had issued i marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an object of vertu he laughed but more i marvelled that the priests should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine to and fro i paced before this skeleton brushed the vines aside broke through the ribs and with a ball of arsacidean twine wandered eddied long amid its many winding shaded colonnades and arbours but soon my line was out and following it back i emerged from the opening where i entered i saw no living thing within naught was there but bones  cutting me a green measuring rod i once more dived within the skeleton from their arrow slit in the skull the priests perceived me taking the altitude of the final rib how now they shouted dar st thou measure this our god that s for us aye priests well how long do ye make him then but hereupon a fierce contest rose among them concerning feet and inches they cracked each other s sconces with their yard sticks the great skull echoed and seizing that lucky chance i quickly concluded my own admeasurements  these admeasurements i now propose to set before you but first be it recorded that in this matter i am not free to utter any fancied measurement i please because there are skeleton authorities you can refer to to test my accuracy there is a leviathanic museum they tell me in hull england one of the whaling ports of that country where they have some fine specimens of fin backs and other whales likewise i have heard that in the museum of manchester in new hampshire they have what the proprietors call the only perfect specimen of a greenland or river whale in the united states moreover at a place in yorkshire england burton constable by name a certain sir clifford constable has in his possession the skeleton of a sperm whale but of moderate size by no means of the full grown magnitude of my friend king tranquo s  in both cases the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar grounds king tranquo seizing his because he wanted it and sir clifford because he was lord of the seignories of those parts sir clifford s whale has been articulated throughout so that like a great chest of drawers you can open and shut him in all his bony cavities spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan and swing all day upon his lower jaw locks are to be put upon some of his trap doors and shutters and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of keys at his side sir clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum and sixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead  the skeleton dimensions i shall now proceed to set down are copied verbatim from my right arm where i had them tattooed as in my wild wanderings at that period there was no other secure way of preserving such valuable statistics but as i was crowded for space and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem i was then composing at least what untattooed parts might remain i did not trouble myself with the odd inches nor indeed should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale
