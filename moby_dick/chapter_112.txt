chapter 108 ahab and the carpenter  the deck first night watch  _carpenter standing before his vice bench and by the light of two lanterns busily filing the ivory joist for the leg which joist is firmly fixed in the vice slabs of ivory leather straps pads screws and various tools of all sorts lying about the bench forward the red flame of the forge is seen where the blacksmith is at work _  drat the file and drat the bone that is hard which should be soft and that is soft which should be hard so we go who file old jaws and shinbones let s try another aye now this works better _sneezes_ halloa this bone dust is _sneezes_ why it s _sneezes_ yes it s _sneezes_ bless my soul it won t let me speak this is what an old fellow gets now for working in dead lumber saw a live tree and you don t get this dust amputate a live bone and you don t get it _sneezes_ come come you old smut there bear a hand and let s have that ferule and buckle screw i ll be ready for them presently lucky now _sneezes_ there s no knee joint to make that might puzzle a little but a mere shinbone why it s easy as making hop poles only i should like to put a good finish on time time if i but only had the time i could turn him out as neat a leg now as ever _sneezes_ scraped to a lady in a parlor those buckskin legs and calves of legs i ve seen in shop windows wouldn t compare at all they soak water they do and of course get rheumatic and have to be doctored _sneezes_ with washes and lotions just like live legs there before i saw it off now i must call his old mogulship and see whether the length will be all right too short if anything i guess ha that s the heel we are in luck here he comes or it s somebody else that s certain  ahab _advancing_ _during the ensuing scene the carpenter continues sneezing at times _  well manmaker  just in time sir if the captain pleases i will now mark the length let me measure sir  measured for a leg good well it s not the first time about it there keep thy finger on it this is a cogent vice thou hast here carpenter let me feel its grip once so so it does pinch some  oh sir it will break bones beware beware  no fear i like a good grip i like to feel something in this slippery world that can hold man what s prometheus about there the blacksmith i mean what s he about  he must be forging the buckle screw sir now  right it s a partnership he supplies the muscle part he makes a fierce red flame there  aye sir he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work  um m so he must i do deem it now a most meaning thing that that old greek prometheus who made men they say should have been a blacksmith and animated them with fire for what s made in fire must properly belong to fire and so hell s probable how the soot flies this must be the remainder the greek made the africans of carpenter when he s through with that buckle tell him to forge a pair of steel shoulder blades there s a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack  sir  hold while prometheus is about it i ll order a complete man after a desirable pattern imprimis fifty feet high in his socks then chest modelled after the thames tunnel then legs with roots to em to stay in one place then arms three feet through the wrist no heart at all brass forehead and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains and let me see shall i order eyes to see outwards no but put a sky light on top of his head to illuminate inwards there take the order and away  now what s he speaking about and who s he speaking to i should like to know shall i keep standing here _aside_  tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome here s one no no no i must have a lantern  ho ho that s it hey here are two sir one will serve my turn  what art thou thrusting that thief catcher into my face for man thrusted light is worse than presented pistols  i thought sir that you spoke to carpenter  carpenter why that s but no a very tidy and i may say an extremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here carpenter or would st thou rather work in clay  sir clay clay sir that s mud we leave clay to ditchers sir  the fellow s impious what art thou sneezing about  bone is rather dusty sir  take the hint then and when thou art dead never bury thyself under living people s noses  sir oh ah i guess so yes oh dear  look ye carpenter i dare say thou callest thyself a right good workmanlike workman eh well then will it speak thoroughly well for thy work if when i come to mount this leg thou makest i shall nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it that is carpenter my old lost leg the flesh and blood one i mean canst thou not drive that old adam away  truly sir i begin to understand somewhat now yes i have heard something curious on that score sir how that a dismasted man never entirely loses the feeling of his old spar but it will be still pricking him at times may i humbly ask if it be really so sir  it is man look put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was so now here is only one distinct leg to the eye yet two to the soul where thou feelest tingling life there exactly there there to a hair do i is t a riddle  i should humbly call it a poser sir  hist then how dost thou know that some entire living thinking thing may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where thou now standest aye and standing there in thy spite in thy most solitary hours then dost thou not fear eavesdroppers hold don t speak and if i still feel the smart of my crushed leg though it be now so long dissolved then why mayst not thou carpenter feel the fiery pains of hell for ever and without a body hah  good lord truly sir if it comes to that i must calculate over again i think i didn t carry a small figure sir  look ye pudding heads should never grant premises how long before the leg is done  perhaps an hour sir  bungle away at it then and bring it to me _turns to go_ oh life here i am proud as greek god and yet standing debtor to this blockhead for a bone to stand on cursed be that mortal inter indebtedness which will not do away with ledgers i would be free as air and i m down in the whole world s books i am so rich i could have given bid for bid with the wealthiest pr√¶torians at the auction of the roman empire which was the world s and yet i owe for the flesh in the tongue i brag with by heavens i ll get a crucible and into it and dissolve myself down to one small compendious vertebra so  carpenter _resuming his work_  well well well stubb knows him best of all and stubb always says he s queer says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer he s queer says stubb he s queer queer queer and keeps dinning it into mr starbuck all the time queer sir queer queer very queer and here s his leg yes now that i think of it here s his bedfellow has a stick of whale s jaw bone for a wife and this is his leg he ll stand on this what was that now about one leg standing in three places and all three places standing in one hell how was that oh i don t wonder he looked so scornful at me i m a sort of strange thoughted sometimes they say but that s only haphazard like then a short little old body like me should never undertake to wade out into deep waters with tall heron built captains the water chucks you under the chin pretty quick and there s a great cry for life boats and here s the heron s leg long and slim sure enough now for most folks one pair of legs lasts a lifetime and that must be because they use them mercifully as a tender hearted old lady uses her roly poly old coach horses but ahab oh he s a hard driver look driven one leg to death and spavined the other for life and now wears out bone legs by the cord halloa there you smut bear a hand there with those screws and let s finish it before the resurrection fellow comes a calling with his horn for all legs true or false as brewery men go round collecting old beer barrels to fill em up again what a leg this is it looks like a real live leg filed down to nothing but the core he ll be standing on this to morrow he ll be taking altitudes on it halloa i almost forgot the little oval slate smoothed ivory where he figures up the latitude so so chisel file and sand paper now
