chapter 109 ahab and starbuck in the cabin  according to usage they were pumping the ship next morning and lo no inconsiderable oil came up with the water the casks below must have sprung a bad leak much concern was shown and starbuck went down into the cabin to report this unfavourable affair  in sperm whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board it is a regular semi weekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold and drench the casks with sea water which afterwards at varying intervals is removed by the ship s pumps hereby the casks are sought to be kept damply tight while by the changed character of the withdrawn water the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo  now from the south and west the pequod was drawing nigh to formosa and the bashee isles between which lies one of the tropical outlets from the china waters into the pacific and so starbuck found ahab with a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him and another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the japanese islands niphon matsmai and sikoke with his snow white new ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table and with a long pruning hook of a jack knife in his hand the wondrous old man with his back to the gangway door was wrinkling his brow and tracing his old courses again  who s there hearing the footstep at the door but not turning round to it on deck begone  captain ahab mistakes it is i the oil in the hold is leaking sir we must up burtons and break out  up burtons and break out now that we are nearing japan heave to here for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops  either do that sir or waste in one day more oil than we may make good in a year what we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth saving sir  so it is so it is if we get it  i was speaking of the oil in the hold sir  and i was not speaking or thinking of that at all begone let it leak i m all aleak myself aye leaks in leaks not only full of leaky casks but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship and that s a far worse plight than the pequod s man yet i don t stop to plug my leak for who can find it in the deep loaded hull or how hope to plug it even if found in this life s howling gale starbuck i ll not have the burtons hoisted  what will the owners say sir  let the owners stand on nantucket beach and outyell the typhoons what cares ahab owners owners thou art always prating to me starbuck about those miserly owners as if the owners were my conscience but look ye the only real owner of anything is its commander and hark ye my conscience is in this ship s keel on deck  captain ahab said the reddening mate moving further into the cabin with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation of itself but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself a better man than i might well pass over in thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man aye and in a happier captain ahab  devils dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of me on deck  nay sir not yet i do entreat and i do dare sir to be forbearing shall we not understand each other better than hitherto captain ahab  ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack forming part of most south sea men s cabin furniture and pointing it towards starbuck exclaimed there is one god that is lord over the earth and one captain that is lord over the pequod on deck  for an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate and his fiery cheeks you would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of the levelled tube but mastering his emotion he half calmly rose and as he quitted the cabin paused for an instant and said thou hast outraged not insulted me sir but for that i ask thee not to beware of starbuck thou wouldst but laugh but let ahab beware of ahab beware of thyself old man  he waxes brave but nevertheless obeys most careful bravery that murmured ahab as starbuck disappeared what s that he said ahab beware of ahab there s something there then unconsciously using the musket for a staff with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little cabin but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed and returning the gun to the rack he went to the deck  thou art but too good a fellow starbuck he said lowly to the mate then raising his voice to the crew furl the t gallant sails and close reef the top sails fore and aft back the main yard up burton and break out in the main hold  it were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was that as respecting starbuck ahab thus acted it may have been a flash of honesty in him or mere prudential policy which under the circumstance imperiously forbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection however transient in the important chief officer of his ship however it was his orders were executed and the burtons were hoisted
