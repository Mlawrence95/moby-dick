chapter 113 the forge  with matted beard and swathed in a bristling shark skin apron about mid day perth was standing between his forge and anvil the latter placed upon an iron wood log with one hand holding a pike head in the coals and with the other at his forge s lungs when captain ahab came along carrying in his hand a small rusty looking leathern bag while yet a little distance from the forge moody ahab paused till at last perth withdrawing his iron from the fire began hammering it upon the anvil the red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights some of which flew close to ahab  are these thy mother carey s chickens perth they are always flying in thy wake birds of good omen too but not to all look here they burn but thou thou liv st among them without a scorch  because i am scorched all over captain ahab answered perth resting for a moment on his hammer i am past scorching not easily can st thou scorch a scar  well well no more thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly sanely woeful to me in no paradise myself i am impatient of all misery in others that is not mad thou should st go mad blacksmith say why dost thou not go mad how can st thou endure without being mad do the heavens yet hate thee that thou can st not go mad what wert thou making there  welding an old pike head sir there were seams and dents in it  and can st thou make it all smooth again blacksmith after such hard usage as it had  i think so sir  and i suppose thou can st smoothe almost any seams and dents never mind how hard the metal blacksmith  aye sir i think i can all seams and dents but one  look ye here then cried ahab passionately advancing and leaning with both hands on perth s shoulders look ye here _here_ can ye smoothe out a seam like this blacksmith sweeping one hand across his ribbed brow if thou could st blacksmith glad enough would i lay my head upon thy anvil and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes answer can st thou smoothe this seam  oh that is the one sir said i not all seams and dents but one  aye blacksmith it is the one aye man it is unsmoothable for though thou only see st it here in my flesh it has worked down into the bone of my skull _that_ is all wrinkles but away with child s play no more gaffs and pikes to day look ye here jingling the leathern bag as if it were full of gold coins i too want a harpoon made one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part perth something that will stick in a whale like his own fin bone there s the stuff flinging the pouch upon the anvil look ye blacksmith these are the gathered nail stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses  horse shoe stubbs sir why captain ahab thou hast here then the best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work  i know it old man these stubbs will weld together like glue from the melted bones of murderers quick forge me the harpoon and forge me first twelve rods for its shank then wind and twist and hammer these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow line quick i ll blow the fire  when at last the twelve rods were made ahab tried them one by one by spiralling them with his own hand round a long heavy iron bolt a flaw rejecting the last one work that over again perth  this done perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one when ahab stayed his hand and said he would weld his own iron as then with regular gasping hems he hammered on the anvil perth passing to him the glowing rods one after the other and the hard pressed forge shooting up its intense straight flame the parsee passed silently and bowing over his head towards the fire seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil but as ahab looked up he slid aside  what s that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for muttered stubb looking on from the forecastle that parsee smells fire like a fusee and smells of it himself like a hot musket s powder pan  at last the shank in one complete rod received its final heat and as perth to temper it plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near by the scalding steam shot up into ahab s bent face  would st thou brand me perth wincing for a moment with the pain have i been but forging my own branding iron then  pray god not that yet i fear something captain ahab is not this harpoon for the white whale  for the white fiend but now for the barbs thou must make them thyself man here are my razors the best of steel here and make the barbs sharp as the needle sleet of the icy sea  for a moment the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain not use them  take them man i have no need for them for i now neither shave sup nor pray till but here to work  fashioned at last into an arrowy shape and welded by perth to the shank the steel soon pointed the end of the iron and as the blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat prior to tempering them he cried to ahab to place the water cask near  no no no water for that i want it of the true death temper ahoy there tashtego queequeg daggoo what say ye pagans will ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb holding it high up a cluster of dark nods replied yes three punctures were made in the heathen flesh and the white whale s barbs were then tempered  ego non baptizo te in nomine patris sed in nomine diaboli deliriously howled ahab as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the baptismal blood  now mustering the spare poles from below and selecting one of hickory with the bark still investing it ahab fitted the end to the socket of the iron a coil of new tow line was then unwound and some fathoms of it taken to the windlass and stretched to a great tension pressing his foot upon it till the rope hummed like a harp string then eagerly bending over it and seeing no strandings ahab exclaimed good and now for the seizings  at one extremity the rope was unstranded and the separate spread yarns were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon the pole was then driven hard up into the socket from the lower end the rope was traced half way along the pole s length and firmly secured so with intertwistings of twine this done pole iron and rope like the three fates remained inseparable and ahab moodily stalked away with the weapon the sound of his ivory leg and the sound of the hickory pole both hollowly ringing along every plank but ere he entered his cabin light unnatural half bantering yet most piteous sound was heard oh pip thy wretched laugh thy idle but unresting eye all thy strange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship and mocked it
