chapter 115 the pequod meets the bachelor  and jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down before the wind some few weeks after ahab s harpoon had been welded  it was a nantucket ship the bachelor which had just wedged in her last cask of oil and bolted down her bursting hatches and now in glad holiday apparel was joyously though somewhat vain gloriously sailing round among the widely separated ships on the ground previous to pointing her prow for home  the three men at her mast head wore long streamers of narrow red bunting at their hats from the stern a whale boat was suspended bottom down and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last whale they had slain signals ensigns and jacks of all colours were flying from her rigging on every side sideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm above which in her top mast cross trees you saw slender breakers of the same precious fluid and nailed to her main truck was a brazen lamp  as was afterwards learned the bachelor had met with the most surprising success all the more wonderful for that while cruising in the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single fish not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm but additional supplemental casks had been bartered for from the ships she had met and these were stowed along the deck and in the captain s and officers state rooms even the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindling wood and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an oil butt lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece in the forecastle the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests and filled them it was humorously added that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler and filled it that the steward had plugged his spare coffee pot and filled it that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled them that indeed everything was filled with sperm except the captain s pantaloons pockets and those he reserved to thrust his hands into in self complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction  as this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody pequod the barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle and drawing still nearer a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge try pots which covered with the parchment like _poke_ or stomach skin of the black fish gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched hands of the crew on the quarter deck the mates and harpooneers were dancing with the olive hued girls who had eloped with them from the polynesian isles while suspended in an ornamented boat firmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast three long island negroes with glittering fiddle bows of whale ivory were presiding over the hilarious jig meanwhile others of the ship s company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the try works from which the huge pots had been removed you would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed bastille such wild cries they raised as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the sea  lord and master over all this scene the captain stood erect on the ship s elevated quarter deck so that the whole rejoicing drama was full before him and seemed merely contrived for his own individual diversion  and ahab he too was standing on his quarter deck shaggy and black with a stubborn gloom and as the two ships crossed each other s wakes one all jubilations for things passed the other all forebodings as to things to come their two captains in themselves impersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene  come aboard come aboard cried the gay bachelor s commander lifting a glass and a bottle in the air  hast seen the white whale gritted ahab in reply  no only heard of him but don t believe in him at all said the other good humoredly come aboard  thou art too damned jolly sail on hast lost any men  not enough to speak of two islanders that s all but come aboard old hearty come along i ll soon take that black from your brow come along will ye merry s the play a full ship and homeward bound  how wondrous familiar is a fool muttered ahab then aloud thou art a full ship and homeward bound thou sayst well then call me an empty ship and outward bound so go thy ways and i will mine forward there set all sail and keep her to the wind  and thus while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze the other stubbornly fought against it and so the two vessels parted the crew of the pequod looking with grave lingering glances towards the receding bachelor but the bachelor s men never heeding their gaze for the lively revelry they were in and as ahab leaning over the taffrail eyed the homeward bound craft he took from his pocket a small vial of sand and then looking from the ship to the vial seemed thereby bringing two remote associations together for that vial was filled with nantucket soundings
