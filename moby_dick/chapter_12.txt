chapter 12 biographical  queequeg was a native of rokovoko an island far away to the west and south it is not down in any map true places never are  when a new hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a grass clout followed by the nibbling goats as if he were a green sapling even then in queequeg s ambitious soul lurked a strong desire to see something more of christendom than a specimen whaler or two his father was a high chief a king his uncle a high priest and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable warriors there was excellent blood in his veins royal stuff though sadly vitiated i fear by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his untutored youth  a sag harbor ship visited his father s bay and queequeg sought a passage to christian lands but the ship having her full complement of seamen spurned his suit and not all the king his father s influence could prevail but queequeg vowed a vow alone in his canoe he paddled off to a distant strait which he knew the ship must pass through when she quitted the island on one side was a coral reef on the other a low tongue of land covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the water hiding his canoe still afloat among these thickets with its prow seaward he sat down in the stern paddle low in hand and when the ship was gliding by like a flash he darted out gained her side with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe climbed up the chains and throwing himself at full length upon the deck grappled a ring bolt there and swore not to let it go though hacked in pieces  in vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard suspended a cutlass over his naked wrists queequeg was the son of a king and queequeg budged not struck by his desperate dauntlessness and his wild desire to visit christendom the captain at last relented and told him he might make himself at home but this fine young savage this sea prince of wales never saw the captain s cabin they put him down among the sailors and made a whaleman of him but like czar peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen for at bottom so he told me he was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the christians the arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were and more than that still better than they were but alas the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that even christians could be both miserable and wicked infinitely more so than all his father s heathens arrived at last in old sag harbor and seeing what the sailors did there and then going on to nantucket and seeing how they spent their wages in _that_ place also poor queequeg gave it up for lost thought he it s a wicked world in all meridians i ll die a pagan  and thus an old idolator at heart he yet lived among these christians wore their clothes and tried to talk their gibberish hence the queer ways about him though now some time from home  by hints i asked him whether he did not propose going back and having a coronation since he might now consider his father dead and gone he being very old and feeble at the last accounts he answered no not yet and added that he was fearful christianity or rather christians had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan kings before him but by and by he said he would return as soon as he felt himself baptized again for the nonce however he proposed to sail about and sow his wild oats in all four oceans they had made a harpooneer of him and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now  i asked him what might be his immediate purpose touching his future movements he answered to go to sea again in his old vocation upon this i told him that whaling was my own design and informed him of my intention to sail out of nantucket as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from he at once resolved to accompany me to that island ship aboard the same vessel get into the same watch the same boat the same mess with me in short to share my every hap with both my hands in his boldly dip into the potluck of both worlds to all this i joyously assented for besides the affection i now felt for queequeg he was an experienced harpooneer and as such could not fail to be of great usefulness to one who like me was wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling though well acquainted with the sea as known to merchant seamen  his story being ended with his pipe s last dying puff queequeg embraced me pressed his forehead against mine and blowing out the light we rolled over from each other this way and that and very soon were sleeping
