chapter 117 the whale watch  the four whales slain that evening had died wide apart one far to windward one less distant to leeward one ahead one astern these last three were brought alongside ere nightfall but the windward one could not be reached till morning and the boat that had killed it lay by its side all night and that boat was ahab s  the waif pole was thrust upright into the dead whale s spout hole and the lantern hanging from its top cast a troubled flickering glare upon the black glossy back and far out upon the midnight waves which gently chafed the whale s broad flank like soft surf upon a beach  ahab and all his boat s crew seemed asleep but the parsee who crouching in the bow sat watching the sharks that spectrally played round the whale and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails a sound like the moaning in squadrons over asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of gomorrah ran shuddering through the air  started from his slumbers ahab face to face saw the parsee and hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a flooded world i have dreamed it again said he  of the hearses have i not said old man that neither hearse nor coffin can be thine  and who are hearsed that die on the sea  but i said old man that ere thou couldst die on this voyage two hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea the first not made by mortal hands and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in america  aye aye a strange sight that parsee a hearse and its plumes floating over the ocean with the waves for the pall bearers ha such a sight we shall not soon see  believe it or not thou canst not die till it be seen old man  and what was that saying about thyself  though it come to the last i shall still go before thee thy pilot  and when thou art so gone before if that ever befall then ere i can follow thou must still appear to me to pilot me still was it not so well then did i believe all ye say oh my pilot i have here two pledges that i shall yet slay moby dick and survive it  take another pledge old man said the parsee as his eyes lighted up like fire flies in the gloom hemp only can kill thee  the gallows ye mean i am immortal then on land and on sea cried ahab with a laugh of derision immortal on land and on sea  both were silent again as one man the grey dawn came on and the slumbering crew arose from the boat s bottom and ere noon the dead whale was brought to the ship
