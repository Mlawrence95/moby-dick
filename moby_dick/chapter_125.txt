chapter 121 midnight the forecastle bulwarks  _stubb and flask mounted on them and passing additional lashings over the anchors there hanging _  no stubb you may pound that knot there as much as you please but you will never pound into me what you were just now saying and how long ago is it since you said the very contrary didn t you once say that whatever ship ahab sails in that ship should pay something extra on its insurance policy just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward stop now didn t you say so  well suppose i did what then i ve part changed my flesh since that time why not my mind besides supposing we _are_ loaded with powder barrels aft and lucifers forward how the devil could the lucifers get afire in this drenching spray here why my little man you have pretty red hair but you couldn t get afire now shake yourself you re aquarius or the water bearer flask might fill pitchers at your coat collar don t you see then that for these extra risks the marine insurance companies have extra guarantees here are hydrants flask but hark again and i ll answer ye the other thing first take your leg off from the crown of the anchor here though so i can pass the rope now listen what s the mighty difference between holding a mast s lightning rod in the storm and standing close by a mast that hasn t got any lightning rod at all in a storm don t you see you timber head that no harm can come to the holder of the rod unless the mast is first struck what are you talking about then not one ship in a hundred carries rods and ahab aye man and all of us were in no more danger then in my poor opinion than all the crews in ten thousand ships now sailing the seas why you king post you i suppose you would have every man in the world go about with a small lightning rod running up the corner of his hat like a militia officer s skewered feather and trailing behind like his sash why don t ye be sensible flask it s easy to be sensible why don t ye then any man with half an eye can be sensible  i don t know that stubb you sometimes find it rather hard  yes when a fellow s soaked through it s hard to be sensible that s a fact and i am about drenched with this spray never mind catch the turn there and pass it seems to me we are lashing down these anchors now as if they were never going to be used again tying these two anchors here flask seems like tying a man s hands behind him and what big generous hands they are to be sure these are your iron fists hey what a hold they have too i wonder flask whether the world is anchored anywhere if she is she swings with an uncommon long cable though there hammer that knot down and we ve done so next to touching land lighting on deck is the most satisfactory i say just wring out my jacket skirts will ye thank ye they laugh at long togs so flask but seems to me a long tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storms afloat the tails tapering down that way serve to carry off the water d ye see same with cocked hats the cocks form gable end eave troughs flask no more monkey jackets and tarpaulins for me i must mount a swallow tail and drive down a beaver so halloa whew there goes my tarpaulin overboard lord lord that the winds that come from heaven should be so unmannerly this is a nasty night lad
