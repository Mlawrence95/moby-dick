chapter 123 the musket  during the most violent shocks of the typhoon the man at the pequod s jaw bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by its spasmodic motions even though preventer tackles had been attached to it for they were slack because some play to the tiller was indispensable  in a severe gale like this while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock to the blast it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the compasses at intervals go round and round it was thus with the pequod s at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards it is a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted emotion  some hours after midnight the typhoon abated so much that through the strenuous exertions of starbuck and stubb one engaged forward and the other aft the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main top sails were cut adrift from the spars and went eddying away to leeward like the feathers of an albatross which sometimes are cast to the winds when that storm tossed bird is on the wing  the three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed and a storm trysail was set further aft so that the ship soon went through the water with some precision again and the course for the present east south east which he was to steer if practicable was once more given to the helmsman for during the violence of the gale he had only steered according to its vicissitudes but as he was now bringing the ship as near her course as possible watching the compass meanwhile lo a good sign the wind seemed coming round astern aye the foul breeze became fair  instantly the yards were squared to the lively song of _ho the fair wind oh ye ho cheerly men _ the crew singing for joy that so promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents preceding it  in compliance with the standing order of his commander to report immediately and at any one of the twenty four hours any decided change in the affairs of the deck starbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards to the breeze however reluctantly and gloomily than he mechanically went below to apprise captain ahab of the circumstance  ere knocking at his state room he involuntarily paused before it a moment the cabin lamp taking long swings this way and that was burning fitfully and casting fitful shadows upon the old man s bolted door a thin one with fixed blinds inserted in place of upper panels the isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming silence to reign there though it was hooped round by all the roar of the elements the loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed as they stood upright against the forward bulkhead starbuck was an honest upright man but out of starbuck s heart at that instant when he saw the muskets there strangely evolved an evil thought but so blent with its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself  he would have shot me once he murmured yes there s the very musket that he pointed at me that one with the studded stock let me touch it lift it strange that i who have handled so many deadly lances strange that i should shake so now loaded i must see aye aye and powder in the pan that s not good best spill it wait i ll cure myself of this i ll hold the musket boldly while i think i come to report a fair wind to him but how fair fair for death and doom _that s_ fair for moby dick it s a fair wind that s only fair for that accursed fish the very tube he pointed at me the very one _this_ one i hold it here he would have killed me with the very thing i handle now aye and he would fain kill all his crew does he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant and in these same perilous seas gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of the error abounding log and in this very typhoon did he not swear that he would have no lightning rods but shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ship s company down to doom with him yes it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more if this ship come to any deadly harm and come to deadly harm my soul swears this ship will if ahab have his way if then he were this instant put aside that crime would not be his ha is he muttering in his sleep yes just there in there he s sleeping sleeping aye but still alive and soon awake again i can t withstand thee then old man not reasoning not remonstrance not entreaty wilt thou hearken to all this thou scornest flat obedience to thy own flat commands this is all thou breathest aye and say st the men have vow d thy vow say st all of us are ahabs great god forbid but is there no other way no lawful way make him a prisoner to be taken home what hope to wrest this old man s living power from his own living hands only a fool would try it say he were pinioned even knotted all over with ropes and hawsers chained down to ring bolts on this cabin floor he would be more hideous than a caged tiger then i could not endure the sight could not possibly fly his howlings all comfort sleep itself inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage what then remains the land is hundreds of leagues away and locked japan the nearest i stand alone here upon an open sea with two oceans and a whole continent between me and law aye aye tis so is heaven a murderer when its lightning strikes a would be murderer in his bed tindering sheets and skin together and would i be a murderer then if and slowly stealthily and half sideways looking he placed the loaded musket s end against the door  on this level ahab s hammock swings within his head this way a touch and starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again oh mary mary boy boy boy but if i wake thee not to death old man who can tell to what unsounded deeps starbuck s body this day week may sink with all the crew great god where art thou shall i shall i the wind has gone down and shifted sir the fore and main topsails are reefed and set she heads her course  stern all oh moby dick i clutch thy heart at last  such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man s tormented sleep as if starbuck s voice had caused the long dumb dream to speak  the yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard s arm against the panel starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel but turning from the door he placed the death tube in its rack and left the place  he s too sound asleep mr stubb go thou down and wake him and tell him i must see to the deck here thou know st what to say
