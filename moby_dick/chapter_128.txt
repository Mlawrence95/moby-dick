chapter 124 the needle  next morning the not yet subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of mighty bulk and striving in the pequod s gurgling track pushed her on like giants palms outspread the strong unstaggering breeze abounded so that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails the whole world boomed before the wind muffled in the full morning light the invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks emblazonings as of crowned babylonian kings and queens reigned over everything the sea was as a crucible of molten gold that bubblingly leaps with light and heat  long maintaining an enchanted silence ahab stood apart and every time the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit he turned to eye the bright sun s rays produced ahead and when she profoundly settled by the stern he turned behind and saw the sun s rearward place and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake  ha ha my ship thou mightest well be taken now for the sea chariot of the sun ho ho all ye nations before my prow i bring the sun to ye yoke on the further billows hallo a tandem i drive the sea  but suddenly reined back by some counter thought he hurried towards the helm huskily demanding how the ship was heading  east sou east sir said the frightened steersman  thou liest smiting him with his clenched fist heading east at this hour in the morning and the sun astern  upon this every soul was confounded for the phenomenon just then observed by ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else but its very blinding palpableness must have been the cause  thrusting his head half way into the binnacle ahab caught one glimpse of the compasses his uplifted arm slowly fell for a moment he almost seemed to stagger standing behind him starbuck looked and lo the two compasses pointed east and the pequod was as infallibly going west  but ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew the old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed i have it it has happened before mr starbuck last night s thunder turned our compasses that s all thou hast before now heard of such a thing i take it  aye but never before has it happened to me sir said the pale mate gloomily  here it must needs be said that accidents like this have in more than one case occurred to ships in violent storms the magnetic energy as developed in the mariner s needle is as all know essentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven hence it is not to be much marvelled at that such things should be instances where the lightning has actually struck the vessel so as to smite down some of the spars and rigging the effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal all its loadstone virtue being annihilated so that the before magnetic steel was of no more use than an old wife s knitting needle but in either case the needle never again of itself recovers the original virtue thus marred or lost and if the binnacle compasses be affected the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson  deliberately standing before the binnacle and eyeing the transpointed compasses the old man with the sharp of his extended hand now took the precise bearing of the sun and satisfied that the needles were exactly inverted shouted out his orders for the ship s course to be changed accordingly the yards were hard up and once more the pequod thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind for the supposed fair one had only been juggling her  meanwhile whatever were his own secret thoughts starbuck said nothing but quietly he issued all requisite orders while stubb and flask who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelings likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced as for the men though some of them lowly rumbled their fear of ahab was greater than their fear of fate but as ever before the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed or if impressed it was only with a certain magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible ahab s  for a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries but chancing to slip with his ivory heel he saw the crushed copper sight tubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck  thou poor proud heaven gazer and sun s pilot yesterday i wrecked thee and to day the compasses would fain have wrecked me so so but ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet mr starbuck a lance without a pole a top maul and the smallest of the sail maker s needles quick  accessory perhaps to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about to do were certain prudential motives whose object might have been to revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill in a matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses besides the old man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles though clumsily practicable was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors without some shudderings and evil portents  men said he steadily turning upon the crew as the mate handed him the things he had demanded my men the thunder turned old ahab s needles but out of this bit of steel ahab can make one of his own that will point as true as any  abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors as this was said and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might follow but starbuck looked away  with a blow from the top maul ahab knocked off the steel head of the lance and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining bade him hold it upright without its touching the deck then with the maul after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod he placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it and less strongly hammered that several times the mate still holding the rod as before then going through some small strange motions with it whether indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel or merely intended to augment the awe of the crew is uncertain he called for linen thread and moving to the binnacle slipped out the two reversed needles there and horizontally suspended the sail needle by its middle over one of the compass cards at first the steel went round and round quivering and vibrating at either end but at last it settled to its place when ahab who had been intently watching for this result stepped frankly back from the binnacle and pointing his stretched arm towards it exclaimed look ye for yourselves if ahab be not lord of the level loadstone the sun is east and that compass swears it  one after another they peered in for nothing but their own eyes could persuade such ignorance as theirs and one after another they slunk away  in his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph you then saw ahab in all his fatal pride
