chapter 125 the log and line  while now the fated pequod had been so long afloat this voyage the log and line had but very seldom been in use owing to a confident reliance upon other means of determining the vessel s place some merchantmen and many whalemen especially when cruising wholly neglect to heave the log though at the same time and frequently more for form s sake than anything else regularly putting down upon the customary slate the course steered by the ship as well as the presumed average rate of progression every hour it had been thus with the pequod the wooden reel and angular log attached hung long untouched just beneath the railing of the after bulwarks rains and spray had damped it sun and wind had warped it all the elements had combined to rot a thing that hung so idly but heedless of all this his mood seized ahab as he happened to glance upon the reel not many hours after the magnet scene and he remembered how his quadrant was no more and recalled his frantic oath about the level log and line the ship was sailing plungingly astern the billows rolled in riots  forward there heave the log  two seamen came the golden hued tahitian and the grizzly manxman take the reel one of ye i ll heave  they went towards the extreme stern on the ship s lee side where the deck with the oblique energy of the wind was now almost dipping into the creamy sidelong rushing sea  the manxman took the reel and holding it high up by the projecting handle ends of the spindle round which the spool of line revolved so stood with the angular log hanging downwards till ahab advanced to him  ahab stood before him and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty turns to form a preliminary hand coil to toss overboard when the old manxman who was intently eyeing both him and the line made bold to speak  sir i mistrust it this line looks far gone long heat and wet have spoiled it  twill hold old gentleman long heat and wet have they spoiled thee thou seem st to hold or truer perhaps life holds thee not thou it  i hold the spool sir but just as my captain says with these grey hairs of mine tis not worth while disputing specially with a superior who ll ne er confess  what s that there now s a patched professor in queen nature s granite founded college but methinks he s too subservient where wert thou born  in the little rocky isle of man sir  excellent thou st hit the world by that  i know not sir but i was born there  in the isle of man hey well the other way it s good here s a man from man a man born in once independent man and now unmanned of man which is sucked in by what up with the reel the dead blind wall butts all inquiring heads at last up with it so  the log was heaved the loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long dragging line astern and then instantly the reel began to whirl in turn jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows the towing resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely  hold hard  snap the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon the tugging log was gone  i crush the quadrant the thunder turns the needles and now the mad sea parts the log line but ahab can mend all haul in here tahitian reel up manxman and look ye let the carpenter make another log and mend thou the line see to it  there he goes now to him nothing s happened but to me the skewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world haul in haul in tahitian these lines run whole and whirling out come in broken and dragging slow ha pip come to help eh pip  pip whom call ye pip pip jumped from the whale boat pip s missing let s see now if ye haven t fished him up here fisherman it drags hard i guess he s holding on jerk him tahiti jerk him off we haul in no cowards here ho there s his arm just breaking water a hatchet a hatchet cut it off we haul in no cowards here captain ahab sir sir here s pip trying to get on board again  peace thou crazy loon cried the manxman seizing him by the arm away from the quarter deck  the greater idiot ever scolds the lesser muttered ahab advancing hands off from that holiness where sayest thou pip was boy  astern there sir astern lo lo  and who art thou boy i see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of thy eyes oh god that man should be a thing for immortal souls to sieve through who art thou boy  bell boy sir ship s crier ding dong ding pip pip pip one hundred pounds of clay reward for pip five feet high looks cowardly quickest known by that ding dong ding who s seen pip the coward  there can be no hearts above the snow line oh ye frozen heavens look down here ye did beget this luckless child and have abandoned him ye creative libertines here boy ahab s cabin shall be pip s home henceforth while ahab lives thou touchest my inmost centre boy thou art tied to me by cords woven of my heart strings come let s down  what s this here s velvet shark skin intently gazing at ahab s hand and feeling it ah now had poor pip but felt so kind a thing as this perhaps he had ne er been lost this seems to me sir as a man rope something that weak souls may hold by oh sir let old perth now come and rivet these two hands together the black one with the white for i will not let this go  oh boy nor will i thee unless i should thereby drag thee to worse horrors than are here come then to my cabin lo ye believers in gods all goodness and in man all ill lo you see the omniscient gods oblivious of suffering man and man though idiotic and knowing not what he does yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude come i feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand than though i grasped an emperor s  there go two daft ones now muttered the old manxman one daft with strength the other daft with weakness but here s the end of the rotten line all dripping too mend it eh i think we had best have a new line altogether i ll see mr stubb about it
