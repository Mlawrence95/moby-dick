chapter 13 wheelbarrow  next morning monday after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber for a block i settled my own and comrade s bill using however my comrade s money the grinning landlord as well as the boarders seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me and queequeg especially as peter coffin s cock and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person whom i now companied with  we borrowed a wheelbarrow and embarking our things including my own poor carpet bag and queequeg s canvas sack and hammock away we went down to the moss the little nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf as we were going along the people stared not at queequeg so much for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms but we heeded them not going along wheeling the barrow by turns and queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs i asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore and whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons to this in substance he replied that though what i hinted was true enough yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon because it was of assured stuff well tried in many a mortal combat and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales in short like many inland reapers and mowers who go into the farmers meadows armed with their own scythes though in no wise obliged to furnish them even so queequeg for his own private reasons preferred his own harpoon  shifting the barrow from my hand to his he told me a funny story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen it was in sag harbor the owners of his ship it seems had lent him one in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding house not to seem ignorant about the thing though in truth he was entirely so concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrow queequeg puts his chest upon it lashes it fast and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf why said i queequeg you might have known better than that one would think didn t the people laugh  upon this he told me another story the people of his island of rokovoko it seems at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held now a certain grand merchant ship once touched at rokovoko and its commander from all accounts a very stately punctilious gentleman at least for a sea captain this commander was invited to the wedding feast of queequeg s sister a pretty young princess just turned of ten well when all the wedding guests were assembled at the bride s bamboo cottage this captain marches in and being assigned the post of honor placed himself over against the punchbowl and between the high priest and his majesty the king queequeg s father grace being said for those people have their grace as well as we though queequeg told me that unlike us who at such times look downwards to our platters they on the contrary copying the ducks glance upwards to the great giver of all feasts grace i say being said the high priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island that is dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates seeing himself placed next the priest and noting the ceremony and thinking himself being captain of a ship as having plain precedence over a mere island king especially in the king s own house the captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl taking it i suppose for a huge finger glass now said queequeg what you tink now didn t our people laugh  at last passage paid and luggage safe we stood on board the schooner hoisting sail it glided down the acushnet river on one side new bedford rose in terraces of streets their ice covered trees all glittering in the clear cold air huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves and side by side the world wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers with blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch all betokening that new cruises were on the start that one most perilous and long voyage ended only begins a second and a second ended only begins a third and so on for ever and for aye such is the endlessness yea the intolerableness of all earthly effort  gaining the more open water the bracing breeze waxed fresh the little moss tossed the quick foam from her bows as a young colt his snortings how i snuffed that tartar air how i spurned that turnpike earth that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no records  at the same foam fountain queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me his dusky nostrils swelled apart he showed his filed and pointed teeth on on we flew and our offing gained the moss did homage to the blast ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the sultan sideways leaning we sideways darted every ropeyarn tingling like a wire the two tall masts buckling like indian canes in land tornadoes so full of this reeling scene were we as we stood by the plunging bowsprit that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers a lubber like assembly who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so companionable as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro but there were some boobies and bumpkins there who by their intense greenness must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his back i thought the bumpkin s hour of doom was come dropping his harpoon the brawny savage caught him in his arms and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength sent him high up bodily into the air then slightly tapping his stern in mid somerset the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet while queequeg turning his back upon him lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff  capting capting yelled the bumpkin running towards that officer capting capting here s the devil  hallo _you_ sir cried the captain a gaunt rib of the sea stalking up to queequeg what in thunder do you mean by that don t you know you might have killed that chap  what him say said queequeg as he mildly turned to me  he say said i that you came near kill e that man there pointing to the still shivering greenhorn  kill e cried queequeg twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly expression of disdain ah him bevy small e fish e queequeg no kill e so small e fish e queequeg kill e big whale  look you roared the captain i ll kill e _you_ you cannibal if you try any more of your tricks aboard here so mind your eye  but it so happened just then that it was high time for the captain to mind his own eye the prodigious strain upon the main sail had parted the weather sheet and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck the poor fellow whom queequeg had handled so roughly was swept overboard all hands were in a panic and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it seemed madness it flew from right to left and back again almost in one ticking of a watch and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinters nothing was done and nothing seemed capable of being done those on deck rushed towards the bows and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale in the midst of this consternation queequeg dropped deftly to his knees and crawling under the path of the boom whipped hold of a rope secured one end to the bulwarks and then flinging the other like a lasso caught it round the boom as it swept over his head and at the next jerk the spar was that way trapped and all was safe the schooner was run into the wind and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat queequeg stripped to the waist darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap for three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog throwing his long arms straight out before him and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam i looked at the grand and glorious fellow but saw no one to be saved the greenhorn had gone down shooting himself perpendicularly from the water queequeg now took an instant s glance around him and seeming to see just how matters were dived down and disappeared a few minutes more and he rose again one arm still striking out and with the other dragging a lifeless form the boat soon picked them up the poor bumpkin was restored all hands voted queequeg a noble trump the captain begged his pardon from that hour i clove to queequeg like a barnacle yea till poor queequeg took his last long dive  was there ever such unconsciousness he did not seem to think that he at all deserved a medal from the humane and magnanimous societies he only asked for water fresh water something to wipe the brine off that done he put on dry clothes lighted his pipe and leaning against the bulwarks and mildly eyeing those around him seemed to be saying to himself it s a mutual joint stock world in all meridians we cannibals must help these christians
