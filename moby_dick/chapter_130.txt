chapter 126 the life buoy  steering now south eastward by ahab s levelled steel and her progress solely determined by ahab s level log and line the pequod held on her path towards the equator making so long a passage through such unfrequented waters descrying no ships and ere long sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds over waves monotonously mild all these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous and desperate scene  at last when the ship drew near to the outskirts as it were of the equatorial fishing ground and in the deep darkness that goes before the dawn was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets the watch then headed by flask was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthly like half articulated wailings of the ghosts of all herod s murdered innocents that one and all they started from their reveries and for the space of some moments stood or sat or leaned all transfixedly listening like the carved roman slave while that wild cry remained within hearing the christian or civilized part of the crew said it was mermaids and shuddered but the pagan harpooneers remained unappalled yet the grey manxman the oldest mariner of all declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea  below in his hammock ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn when he came to the deck it was then recounted to him by flask not unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings he hollowly laughed and thus explained the wonder  those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers of seals and some young seals that had lost their dams or some dams that had lost their cubs must have risen nigh the ship and kept company with her crying and sobbing with their human sort of wail but this only the more affected some of them because most mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals arising not only from their peculiar tones when in distress but also from the human look of their round heads and semi intelligent faces seen peeringly uprising from the water alongside in the sea under certain circumstances seals have more than once been mistaken for men  but the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning at sun rise this man went from his hammock to his mast head at the fore and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep for sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state whether it was thus with the man there is now no telling but be that as it may he had not been long at his perch when a cry was heard a cry and a rushing and looking up they saw a falling phantom in the air and looking down a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the sea  the life buoy a long slender cask was dropped from the stern where it always hung obedient to a cunning spring but no hand rose to seize it and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken so that it slowly filled and that parched wood also filled at its every pore and the studded iron bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom as if to yield him his pillow though in sooth but a hard one  and thus the first man of the pequod that mounted the mast to look out for the white whale on the white whale s own peculiar ground that man was swallowed up in the deep but few perhaps thought of that at the time indeed in some sort they were not grieved at this event at least as a portent for they regarded it not as a foreshadowing of evil in the future but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged they declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had heard the night before but again the old manxman said nay  the lost life buoy was now to be replaced starbuck was directed to see to it but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found and as in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly connected with its final end whatever that might prove to be therefore they were going to leave the ship s stern unprovided with a buoy when by certain strange signs and inuendoes queequeg hinted a hint concerning his coffin  a life buoy of a coffin cried starbuck starting  rather queer that i should say said stubb  it will make a good enough one said flask the carpenter here can arrange it easily  bring it up there s nothing else for it said starbuck after a melancholy pause rig it carpenter do not look at me so the coffin i mean dost thou hear me rig it  and shall i nail down the lid sir moving his hand as with a hammer  aye  and shall i caulk the seams sir moving his hand as with a caulking iron  aye  and shall i then pay over the same with pitch sir moving his hand as with a pitch pot  away what possesses thee to this make a life buoy of the coffin and no more mr stubb mr flask come forward with me  he goes off in a huff the whole he can endure at the parts he baulks now i don t like this i make a leg for captain ahab and he wears it like a gentleman but i make a bandbox for queequeg and he won t put his head into it are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin and now i m ordered to make a life buoy of it it s like turning an old coat going to bring the flesh on the other side now i don t like this cobbling sort of business i don t like it at all it s undignified it s not my place let tinkers brats do tinkerings we are their betters i like to take in hand none but clean virgin fair and square mathematical jobs something that regularly begins at the beginning and is at the middle when midway and comes to an end at the conclusion not a cobbler s job that s at an end in the middle and at the beginning at the end it s the old woman s tricks to be giving cobbling jobs lord what an affection all old women have for tinkers i know an old woman of sixty five who ran away with a bald headed young tinker once and that s the reason i never would work for lonely widow old women ashore when i kept my job shop in the vineyard they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run off with me but heigh ho there are no caps at sea but snow caps let me see nail down the lid caulk the seams pay over the same with pitch batten them down tight and hang it with the snap spring over the ship s stern were ever such things done before with a coffin some superstitious old carpenters now would be tied up in the rigging ere they would do the job but i m made of knotty aroostook hemlock i don t budge cruppered with a coffin sailing about with a grave yard tray but never mind we workers in woods make bridal bedsteads and card tables as well as coffins and hearses we work by the month or by the job or by the profit not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work unless it be too confounded cobbling and then we stash it if we can hem i ll do the job now tenderly i ll have me let s see how many in the ship s company all told but i ve forgotten any way i ll have me thirty separate turk s headed life lines each three feet long hanging all round to the coffin then if the hull go down there ll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin a sight not seen very often beneath the sun come hammer caulking iron pitch pot and marling spike let s to it
