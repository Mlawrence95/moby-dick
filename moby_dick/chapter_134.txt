chapter 130 the hat  and now that at the proper time and place after so long and wide a preliminary cruise ahab all other whaling waters swept seemed to have chased his foe into an ocean fold to slay him the more securely there now that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted now that a vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encountered moby dick and now that all his successive meetings with various ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which the white whale tore his hunters whether sinning or sinned against now it was that there lurked a something in the old man s eyes which it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see as the unsetting polar star which through the livelong arctic six months night sustains its piercing steady central gaze so ahab s purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew it domineered above them so that all their bodings doubts misgivings fears were fain to hide beneath their souls and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf  in this foreshadowing interval too all humor forced or natural vanished stubb no more strove to raise a smile starbuck no more strove to check one alike joy and sorrow hope and fear seemed ground to finest dust and powdered for the time in the clamped mortar of ahab s iron soul like machines they dumbly moved about the deck ever conscious that the old man s despot eye was on them  but did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours when he thought no glance but one was on him then you would have seen that even as ahab s eyes so awed the crew s the inscrutable parsee s glance awed his or somehow at least in some wild way at times affected it such an added gliding strangeness began to invest the thin fedallah now such ceaseless shudderings shook him that the men looked dubious at him half uncertain as it seemed whether indeed he were a mortal substance or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen being s body and that shadow was always hovering there for not by night even had fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber or go below he would stand still for hours but never sat or leaned his wan but wondrous eyes did plainly say we two watchmen never rest  nor at any time by night or day could the mariners now step upon the deck unless ahab was before them either standing in his pivot hole or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits the main mast and the mizen or else they saw him standing in the cabin scuttle his living foot advanced upon the deck as if to step his hat slouched heavily over his eyes so that however motionless he stood however the days and nights were added on that he had not swung in his hammock yet hidden beneath that slouching hat they could never tell unerringly whether for all this his eyes were really closed at times or whether he was still intently scanning them no matter though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch and the unheeded night damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone carved coat and hat the clothes that the night had wet the next day s sunshine dried upon him and so day after day and night after night he went no more beneath the planks whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for  he ate in the same open air that is his two only meals breakfast and dinner supper he never touched nor reaped his beard which darkly grew all gnarled as unearthed roots of trees blown over which still grow idly on at naked base though perished in the upper verdure but though his whole life was now become one watch on deck and though the parsee s mystic watch was without intermission as his own yet these two never seemed to speak one man to the other unless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the twain openly and to the awe struck crew they seemed pole like asunder if by day they chanced to speak one word by night dumb men were both so far as concerned the slightest verbal interchange at times for longest hours without a single hail they stood far parted in the starlight ahab in his scuttle the parsee by the mainmast but still fixedly gazing upon each other as if in the parsee ahab saw his forethrown shadow in ahab the parsee his abandoned substance  and yet somehow did ahab in his own proper self as daily hourly and every instant commandingly revealed to his subordinates ahab seemed an independent lord the parsee but his slave still again both seemed yoked together and an unseen tyrant driving them the lean shade siding the solid rib for be this parsee what he may all rib and keel was solid ahab  at the first faintest glimmering of the dawn his iron voice was heard from aft man the mast heads and all through the day till after sunset and after twilight the same voice every hour at the striking of the helmsman s bell was heard what d ye see sharp sharp  but when three or four days had slided by after meeting the children seeking rachel and no spout had yet been seen the monomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crew s fidelity at least of nearly all except the pagan harpooneers he seemed to doubt even whether stubb and flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought but if these suspicions were really his he sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them however his actions might seem to hint them  i will have the first sight of the whale myself he said aye ahab must have the doubloon and with his own hands he rigged a nest of basketed bowlines and sending a hand aloft with a single sheaved block to secure to the main mast head he received the two ends of the downward reeved rope and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for the other end in order to fasten it at the rail this done with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin he looked round upon his crew sweeping from one to the other pausing his glance long upon daggoo queequeg tashtego but shunning fedallah and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate said take the rope sir i give it into thy hands starbuck then arranging his person in the basket he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last and afterwards stood near it and thus with one hand clinging round the royal mast ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles ahead astern this side and that within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height  when in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the rigging which chances to afford no foothold the sailor at sea is hoisted up to that spot and sustained there by the rope under these circumstances its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it because in such a wilderness of running rigging whose various different relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the deck and when the deck ends of these ropes are being every few minutes cast down from the fastenings it would be but a natural fatality if unprovided with a constant watchman the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea so ahab s proceedings in this matter were not unusual the only strange thing about them seemed to be that starbuck almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree approaching to decision one of those too whose faithfulness on the look out he had seemed to doubt somewhat it was strange that this was the very man he should select for his watchman freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person s hands  now the first time ahab was perched aloft ere he had been there ten minutes one of those red billed savage sea hawks which so often fly incommodiously close round the manned mast heads of whalemen in these latitudes one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings then it darted a thousand feet straight up into the air then spiralized downwards and went eddying again round his head  but with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon ahab seemed not to mark this wild bird nor indeed would any one else have marked it much it being no uncommon circumstance only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight  your hat your hat sir suddenly cried the sicilian seaman who being posted at the mizen mast head stood directly behind ahab though somewhat lower than his level and with a deep gulf of air dividing them  but already the sable wing was before the old man s eyes the long hooked bill at his head with a scream the black hawk darted away with his prize  an eagle flew thrice round tarquin s head removing his cap to replace it and thereupon tanaquil his wife declared that tarquin would be king of rome but only by the replacing of the cap was that omen accounted good ahab s hat was never restored the wild hawk flew on and on with it far in advance of the prow and at last disappeared while from the point of that disappearance a minute black spot was dimly discerned falling from that vast height into the sea
