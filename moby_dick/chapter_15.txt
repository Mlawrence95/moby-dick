chapter 15 chowder  it was quite late in the evening when the little moss came snugly to anchor and queequeg and i went ashore so we could attend to no business that day at least none but a supper and a bed the landlord of the spouter inn had recommended us to his cousin hosea hussey of the try pots whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all nantucket and moreover he had assured us that cousin hosea as he called him was famous for his chowders in short he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot luck at the try pots but the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard and that done then ask the first man we met where the place was these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first especially as at the outset queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse our first point of departure must be left on the larboard hand whereas i had understood peter coffin to say it was on the starboard however by dint of beating about a little in the dark and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way we at last came to something which there was no mistaking  two enormous wooden pots painted black and suspended by asses ears swung from the cross trees of an old top mast planted in front of an old doorway the horns of the cross trees were sawed off on the other side so that this old top mast looked not a little like a gallows perhaps i was over sensitive to such impressions at the time but i could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving a sort of crick was in my neck as i gazed up to the two remaining horns yes _two_ of them one for queequeg and one for me it s ominous thinks i a coffin my innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port tombstones staring at me in the whalemen s chapel and here a gallows and a pair of prodigious black pots too are these last throwing out oblique hints touching tophet  i was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown standing in the porch of the inn under a dull red lamp swinging there that looked much like an injured eye and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt  get along with ye said she to the man or i ll be combing ye  come on queequeg said i all right there s mrs hussey  and so it turned out mr hosea hussey being from home but leaving mrs hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed mrs hussey postponing further scolding for the present ushered us into a little room and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast turned round to us and said clam or cod  what s that about cods ma am said i with much politeness  clam or cod she repeated  a clam for supper a cold clam is _that_ what you mean mrs hussey says i but that s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time ain t it mrs hussey  but being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple shirt who was waiting for it in the entry and seeming to hear nothing but the word clam mrs hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen and bawling out clam for two disappeared  queequeg said i do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam  however a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us but when that smoking chowder came in the mystery was delightfully explained oh sweet friends hearken to me it was made of small juicy clams scarcely bigger than hazel nuts mixed with pounded ship biscuit and salted pork cut up into little flakes the whole enriched with butter and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage and in particular queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him and the chowder being surpassingly excellent we despatched it with great expedition when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of mrs hussey s clam and cod announcement i thought i would try a little experiment stepping to the kitchen door i uttered the word cod with great emphasis and resumed my seat in a few moments the savoury steam came forth again but with a different flavor and in good time a fine cod chowder was placed before us  we resumed business and while plying our spoons in the bowl thinks i to myself i wonder now if this here has any effect on the head what s that stultifying saying about chowder headed people but look queequeg ain t that a live eel in your bowl where s your harpoon  fishiest of all fishy places was the try pots which well deserved its name for the pots there were always boiling chowders chowder for breakfast and chowder for dinner and chowder for supper till you began to look for fish bones coming through your clothes the area before the house was paved with clam shells mrs hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra and hosea hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark skin there was a fishy flavor to the milk too which i could not at all account for till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen s boats i saw hosea s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod s decapitated head looking very slip shod i assure ye  supper concluded we received a lamp and directions from mrs hussey concerning the nearest way to bed but as queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs the lady reached forth her arm and demanded his harpoon she allowed no harpoon in her chambers why not said i every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon but why not because it s dangerous says she ever since young stiggs coming from that unfort nt v y ge of his when he was gone four years and a half with only three barrels of _ile_ was found dead in my first floor back with his harpoon in his side ever since then i allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night so mr queequeg for she had learned his name i will just take this here iron and keep it for you till morning but the chowder clam or cod to morrow for breakfast men  both says i and let s have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety
