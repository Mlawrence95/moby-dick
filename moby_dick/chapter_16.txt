chapter 16 the ship  in bed we concocted our plans for the morrow but to my surprise and no small concern queequeg now gave me to understand that he had been diligently consulting yojo the name of his black little god and yojo had told him two or three times over and strongly insisted upon it everyway that instead of our going together among the whaling fleet in harbor and in concert selecting our craft instead of this i say yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me inasmuch as yojo purposed befriending us and in order to do so had already pitched upon a vessel which if left to myself i ishmael should infallibly light upon for all the world as though it had turned out by chance and in that vessel i must immediately ship myself for the present irrespective of queequeg  i have forgotten to mention that in many things queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of yojo s judgment and surprising forecast of things and cherished yojo with considerable esteem as a rather good sort of god who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs  now this plan of queequeg s or rather yojo s touching the selection of our craft i did not like that plan at all i had not a little relied upon queequeg s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely but as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon queequeg i was obliged to acquiesce and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor that should quickly settle that trifling little affair next morning early leaving queequeg shut up with yojo in our little bedroom for it seemed that it was some sort of lent or ramadan or day of fasting humiliation and prayer with queequeg and yojo that day _how_ it was i never could find out for though i applied myself to it several times i never could master his liturgies and xxxix articles leaving queequeg then fasting on his tomahawk pipe and yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings i sallied out among the shipping after much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries i learnt that there were three ships up for three years voyages the devil dam the tit bit and the pequod _devil dam_ i do not know the origin of _tit bit_ is obvious _pequod_ you will no doubt remember was the name of a celebrated tribe of massachusetts indians now extinct as the ancient medes i peered and pryed about the devil dam from her hopped over to the tit bit and finally going on board the pequod looked around her for a moment and then decided that this was the very ship for us  you may have seen many a quaint craft in your day for aught i know square toed luggers mountainous japanese junks butter box galliots and what not but take my word for it you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old pequod she was a ship of the old school rather small if anything with an old fashioned claw footed look about her long seasoned and weather stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans her old hull s complexion was darkened like a french grenadier s who has alike fought in egypt and siberia her venerable bows looked bearded her masts cut somewhere on the coast of japan where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of cologne her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled like the pilgrim worshipped flag stone in canterbury cathedral where becket bled but to all these her old antiquities were added new and marvellous features pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed old captain peleg many years her chief mate before he commanded another vessel of his own and now a retired seaman and one of the principal owners of the pequod this old peleg during the term of his chief mateship had built upon her original grotesqueness and inlaid it all over with a quaintness both of material and device unmatched by anything except it be thorkill hake s carved buckler or bedstead she was apparelled like any barbaric ethiopian emperor his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory she was a thing of trophies a cannibal of a craft tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies all round her unpanelled open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale inserted there for pins to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea ivory scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm she sported there a tiller and that tiller was in one mass curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe the helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest felt like the tartar when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw a noble craft but somehow a most melancholy all noble things are touched with that  now when i looked about the quarter deck for some one having authority in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage at first i saw nobody but i could not well overlook a strange sort of tent or rather wigwam pitched a little behind the main mast it seemed only a temporary erection used in port it was of a conical shape some ten feet high consisting of the long huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right whale planted with their broad ends on the deck a circle of these slabs laced together mutually sloped towards each other and at the apex united in a tufted point where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top knot on some old pottowottamie sachem s head a triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship so that the insider commanded a complete view forward  and half concealed in this queer tenement i at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority and who it being noon and the ship s work suspended was now enjoying respite from the burden of command he was seated on an old fashioned oaken chair wriggling all over with curious carving and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed  there was nothing so very particular perhaps about the appearance of the elderly man i saw he was brown and brawny like most old seamen and heavily rolled up in blue pilot cloth cut in the quaker style only there was a fine and almost microscopic net work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales and always looking to windward for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together such eye wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl  is this the captain of the pequod said i advancing to the door of the tent  supposing it be the captain of the pequod what dost thou want of him he demanded  i was thinking of shipping  thou wast wast thou i see thou art no nantucketer ever been in a stove boat  no sir i never have  dost know nothing at all about whaling i dare say eh  nothing sir but i have no doubt i shall soon learn i ve been several voyages in the merchant service and i think that  merchant service be damned talk not that lingo to me dost see that leg i ll take that leg away from thy stern if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again marchant service indeed i suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships but flukes man what makes thee want to go a whaling eh it looks a little suspicious don t it eh hast not been a pirate hast thou didst not rob thy last captain didst thou dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea  i protested my innocence of these things i saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendoes this old seaman as an insulated quakerish nantucketer was full of his insular prejudices and rather distrustful of all aliens unless they hailed from cape cod or the vineyard  but what takes thee a whaling i want to know that before i think of shipping ye  well sir i want to see what whaling is i want to see the world  want to see what whaling is eh have ye clapped eye on captain ahab  who is captain ahab sir  aye aye i thought so captain ahab is the captain of this ship  i am mistaken then i thought i was speaking to the captain himself  thou art speaking to captain peleg that s who ye are speaking to young man it belongs to me and captain bildad to see the pequod fitted out for the voyage and supplied with all her needs including crew we are part owners and agents but as i was going to say if thou wantest to know what whaling is as thou tellest ye do i can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it past backing out clap eye on captain ahab young man and thou wilt find that he has only one leg  what do you mean sir was the other one lost by a whale  lost by a whale young man come nearer to me it was devoured chewed up crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat ah ah  i was a little alarmed by his energy perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation but said as calmly as i could what you say is no doubt true enough sir but how could i know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale though indeed i might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident  look ye now young man thy lungs are a sort of soft d ye see thou dost not talk shark a bit _sure_ ye ve been to sea before now sure of that  sir said i i thought i told you that i had been four voyages in the merchant  hard down out of that mind what i said about the marchant service don t aggravate me i won t have it but let us understand each other i have given thee a hint about what whaling is do ye yet feel inclined for it  i do sir  very good now art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale s throat and then jump after it answer quick  i am sir if it should be positively indispensable to do so not to be got rid of that is which i don t take to be the fact  good again now then thou not only wantest to go a whaling to find out by experience what whaling is but ye also want to go in order to see the world was not that what ye said i thought so well then just step forward there and take a peep over the weather bow and then back to me and tell me what ye see there  for a moment i stood a little puzzled by this curious request not knowing exactly how to take it whether humorously or in earnest but concentrating all his crow s feet into one scowl captain peleg started me on the errand  going forward and glancing over the weather bow i perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood tide was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean the prospect was unlimited but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding not the slightest variety that i could see  well what s the report said peleg when i came back what did ye see  not much i replied nothing but water considerable horizon though and there s a squall coming up i think  well what does thou think then of seeing the world do ye wish to go round cape horn to see any more of it eh can t ye see the world where you stand  i was a little staggered but go a whaling i must and i would and the pequod was as good a ship as any i thought the best and all this i now repeated to peleg seeing me so determined he expressed his willingness to ship me  and thou mayest as well sign the papers right off he added come along with ye and so saying he led the way below deck into the cabin  seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure it turned out to be captain bildad who along with captain peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel the other shares as is sometimes the case in these ports being held by a crowd of old annuitants widows fatherless children and chancery wards each owning about the value of a timber head or a foot of plank or a nail or two in the ship people in nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest  now bildad like peleg and indeed many other nantucketers was a quaker the island having been originally settled by that sect and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the quaker only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous for some of these same quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale hunters they are fighting quakers they are quakers with a vengeance  so that there are instances among them of men who named with scripture names a singularly common fashion on the island and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the quaker idiom still from the audacious daring and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities a thousand bold dashes of character not unworthy a scandinavian sea king or a poetical pagan roman and when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force with a globular brain and a ponderous heart who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night watches in the remotest waters and beneath constellations never seen here at the north been led to think untraditionally and independently receiving all nature s sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast and thereby chiefly but with some help from accidental advantages to learn a bold and nervous lofty language that man makes one in a whole nation s census a mighty pageant creature formed for noble tragedies nor will it at all detract from him dramatically regarded if either by birth or other circumstances he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature for all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness be sure of this o young ambition all mortal greatness is but disease but as yet we have not to do with such an one but with quite another and still a man who if indeed peculiar it only results again from another phase of the quaker modified by individual circumstances  like captain peleg captain bildad was a well to do retired whaleman but unlike captain peleg who cared not a rush for what are called serious things and indeed deemed those self same serious things the veriest of all trifles captain bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of nantucket quakerism but all his subsequent ocean life and the sight of many unclad lovely island creatures round the horn all that had not moved this native born quaker one single jot had not so much as altered one angle of his vest still for all this immutableness was there some lack of common consistency about worthy captain bildad though refusing from conscientious scruples to bear arms against land invaders yet himself had illimitably invaded the atlantic and pacific and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed yet had he in his straight bodied coat spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore how now in the contemplative evening of his days the pious bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence i do not know but it did not seem to concern him much and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man s religion is one thing and this practical world quite another this world pays dividends rising from a little cabin boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab to a harpooneer in a broad shad bellied waistcoat from that becoming boat header chief mate and captain and finally a ship owner bildad as i hinted before had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well earned income  now bildad i am sorry to say had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks and in his sea going days a bitter hard task master they told me in nantucket though it certainly seems a curious story that when he sailed the old categut whaleman his crew upon arriving home were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital sore exhausted and worn out for a pious man especially for a quaker he was certainly rather hard hearted to say the least he never used to swear though at his men they said but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel unmitigated hard work out of them when bildad was a chief mate to have his drab coloured eye intently looking at you made you feel completely nervous till you could clutch something a hammer or a marling spike and go to work like mad at something or other never mind what indolence and idleness perished before him his own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character on his long gaunt body he carried no spare flesh no superfluous beard his chin having a soft economical nap to it like the worn nap of his broad brimmed hat  such then was the person that i saw seated on the transom when i followed captain peleg down into the cabin the space between the decks was small and there bolt upright sat old bildad who always sat so and never leaned and this to save his coat tails his broad brim was placed beside him his legs were stiffly crossed his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin and spectacles on nose he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume  bildad cried captain peleg at it again bildad eh ye have been studying those scriptures now for the last thirty years to my certain knowledge how far ye got bildad  as if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate bildad without noticing his present irreverence quietly looked up and seeing me glanced again inquiringly towards peleg  he says he s our man bildad said peleg he wants to ship  dost thee said bildad in a hollow tone and turning round to me  i _dost_ said i unconsciously he was so intense a quaker  what do ye think of him bildad said peleg  he ll do said bildad eyeing me and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible  i thought him the queerest old quaker i ever saw especially as peleg his friend and old shipmate seemed such a blusterer but i said nothing only looking round me sharply peleg now threw open a chest and drawing forth the ship s articles placed pen and ink before him and seated himself at a little table i began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms i would be willing to engage for the voyage i was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages but all hands including the captain received certain shares of the profits called _lays_ and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship s company i was also aware that being a green hand at whaling my own lay would not be very large but considering that i was used to the sea could steer a ship splice a rope and all that i made no doubt that from all i had heard i should be offered at least the 275th lay that is the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage whatever that might eventually amount to and though the 275th lay was what they call a rather _long lay_ yet it was better than nothing and if we had a lucky voyage might pretty nearly pay for the clothing i would wear out on it not to speak of my three years beef and board for which i would not have to pay one stiver  it might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune and so it was a very poor way indeed but i am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me while i am putting up at this grim sign of the thunder cloud upon the whole i thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing but would not have been surprised had i been offered the 200th considering i was of a broad shouldered make  but one thing nevertheless that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this ashore i had heard something of both captain peleg and his unaccountable old crony bildad how that they being the principal proprietors of the pequod therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners left nearly the whole management of the ship s affairs to these two and i did not know but what the stingy old bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands especially as i now found him on board the pequod quite at home there in the cabin and reading his bible as if at his own fireside now while peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack knife old bildad to my no small surprise considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings bildad never heeded us but went on mumbling to himself out of his book _lay_ not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth  well captain bildad interrupted peleg what d ye say what lay shall we give this young man  thou knowest best was the sepulchral reply the seven hundred and seventy seventh wouldn t be too much would it where moth and rust do corrupt but _lay_  _lay_ indeed thought i and such a lay the seven hundred and seventy seventh well old bildad you are determined that i for one shall not _lay_ up many _lays_ here below where moth and rust do corrupt it was an exceedingly _long lay_ that indeed and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy seven is a pretty large number yet when you come to make a _teenth_ of it you will then see i say that the seven hundred and seventy seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy seven gold doubloons and so i thought at the time  why blast your eyes bildad cried peleg thou dost not want to swindle this young man he must have more than that  seven hundred and seventy seventh again said bildad without lifting his eyes and then went on mumbling for where your treasure is there will your heart be also  i am going to put him down for the three hundredth said peleg do ye hear that bildad the three hundredth lay i say  bildad laid down his book and turning solemnly towards him said captain peleg thou hast a generous heart but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship widows and orphans many of them and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans the seven hundred and seventy seventh lay captain peleg  thou bildad roared peleg starting up and clattering about the cabin blast ye captain bildad if i had followed thy advice in these matters i would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round cape horn  captain peleg said bildad steadily thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water or ten fathoms i can t tell but as thou art still an impenitent man captain peleg i greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit captain peleg  fiery pit fiery pit ye insult me man past all natural bearing ye insult me it s an all fired outrage to tell any human creature that he s bound to hell flukes and flames bildad say that again to me and start my soul bolts but i ll i ll yes i ll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on out of the cabin ye canting drab coloured son of a wooden gun a straight wake with ye  as he thundered out this he made a rush at bildad but with a marvellous oblique sliding celerity bildad for that time eluded him  alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded i stepped aside from the door to give egress to bildad who i made no doubt was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of peleg but to my astonishment he sat down again on the transom very quietly and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing he seemed quite used to impenitent peleg and his ways as for peleg after letting off his rage as he had there seemed no more left in him and he too sat down like a lamb though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated whew he whistled at last the squall s gone off to leeward i think bildad thou used to be good at sharpening a lance mend that pen will ye my jack knife here needs the grindstone that s he thank ye bildad now then my young man ishmael s thy name didn t ye say well then down ye go here ishmael for the three hundredth lay  captain peleg said i i have a friend with me who wants to ship too shall i bring him down to morrow  to be sure said peleg fetch him along and we ll look at him  what lay does he want groaned bildad glancing up from the book in which he had again been burying himself  oh never thee mind about that bildad said peleg has he ever whaled it any turning to me  killed more whales than i can count captain peleg  well bring him along then  and after signing the papers off i went nothing doubting but that i had done a good morning s work and that the pequod was the identical ship that yojo had provided to carry queequeg and me round the cape  but i had not proceeded far when i began to bethink me that the captain with whom i was to sail yet remained unseen by me though indeed in many cases a whale ship will be completely fitted out and receive all her crew on board ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief that if the captain have a family or any absorbing concernment of that sort he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea however it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands turning back i accosted captain peleg inquiring where captain ahab was to be found  and what dost thou want of captain ahab it s all right enough thou art shipped  yes but i should like to see him  but i don t think thou wilt be able to at present i don t know exactly what s the matter with him but he keeps close inside the house a sort of sick and yet he don t look so in fact he ain t sick but no he isn t well either any how young man he won t always see me so i don t suppose he will thee he s a queer man captain ahab so some think but a good one oh thou lt like him well enough no fear no fear he s a grand ungodly god like man captain ahab doesn t speak much but when he does speak then you may well listen mark ye be forewarned ahab s above the common ahab s been in colleges as well as mong the cannibals been used to deeper wonders than the waves fixed his fiery lance in mightier stranger foes than whales his lance aye the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle oh he ain t captain bildad no and he ain t captain peleg _he s ahab_ boy and ahab of old thou knowest was a crowned king  and a very vile one when that wicked king was slain the dogs did they not lick his blood  come hither to me hither hither said peleg with a significance in his eye that almost startled me look ye lad never say that on board the pequod never say it anywhere captain ahab did not name himself twas a foolish ignorant whim of his crazy widowed mother who died when he was only a twelvemonth old and yet the old squaw tistig at gayhead said that the name would somehow prove prophetic and perhaps other fools like her may tell thee the same i wish to warn thee it s a lie i know captain ahab well i ve sailed with him as mate years ago i know what he is a good man not a pious good man like bildad but a swearing good man something like me only there s a good deal more of him aye aye i know that he was never very jolly and i know that on the passage home he was a little out of his mind for a spell but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about as any one might see i know too that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale he s been a kind of moody desperate moody and savage sometimes but that will all pass off and once for all let me tell thee and assure thee young man it s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one so good bye to thee and wrong not captain ahab because he happens to have a wicked name besides my boy he has a wife not three voyages wedded a sweet resigned girl think of that by that sweet girl that old man has a child hold ye then there can be any utter hopeless harm in ahab no no my lad stricken blasted if he be ahab has his humanities  as i walked away i was full of thoughtfulness what had been incidentally revealed to me of captain ahab filled me with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him and somehow at the time i felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him but for i don t know what unless it was the cruel loss of his leg and yet i also felt a strange awe of him but that sort of awe which i cannot at all describe was not exactly awe i do not know what it was but i felt it and it did not disincline me towards him though i felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in him so imperfectly as he was known to me then however my thoughts were at length carried in other directions so that for the present dark ahab slipped my mind
