chapter 17 the ramadan  as queequeg s ramadan or fasting and humiliation was to continue all day i did not choose to disturb him till towards night fall for i cherish the greatest respect towards everybody s religious obligations never mind how comical and could not find it in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad stool or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name  i say we good presbyterian christians should be charitable in these things and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals pagans and what not because of their half crazy conceits on these subjects there was queequeg now certainly entertaining the most absurd notions about yojo and his ramadan but what of that queequeg thought he knew what he was about i suppose he seemed to be content and there let him rest all our arguing with him would not avail let him be i say and heaven have mercy on us all presbyterians and pagans alike for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head and sadly need mending  towards evening when i felt assured that all his performances and rituals must be over i went up to his room and knocked at the door but no answer i tried to open it but it was fastened inside queequeg said i softly through the key hole all silent i say queequeg why don t you speak it s i ishmael but all remained still as before i began to grow alarmed i had allowed him such abundant time i thought he might have had an apoplectic fit i looked through the key hole but the door opening into an odd corner of the room the key hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one i could only see part of the foot board of the bed and a line of the wall but nothing more i was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of queequeg s harpoon which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him before our mounting to the chamber that s strange thought i but at any rate since the harpoon stands yonder and he seldom or never goes abroad without it therefore he must be inside here and no possible mistake  queequeg queequeg all still something must have happened apoplexy i tried to burst open the door but it stubbornly resisted running down stairs i quickly stated my suspicions to the first person i met the chamber maid la la she cried i thought something must be the matter i went to make the bed after breakfast and the door was locked and not a mouse to be heard and it s been just so silent ever since but i thought may be you had both gone off and locked your baggage in for safe keeping la la ma am mistress murder mrs hussey apoplexy and with these cries she ran towards the kitchen i following  mrs hussey soon appeared with a mustard pot in one hand and a vinegar cruet in the other having just broken away from the occupation of attending to the castors and scolding her little black boy meantime  wood house cried i which way to it run for god s sake and fetch something to pry open the door the axe the axe he s had a stroke depend upon it and so saying i was unmethodically rushing up stairs again empty handed when mrs hussey interposed the mustard pot and vinegar cruet and the entire castor of her countenance  what s the matter with you young man  get the axe for god s sake run for the doctor some one while i pry it open  look here said the landlady quickly putting down the vinegar cruet so as to have one hand free look here are you talking about prying open any of my doors and with that she seized my arm what s the matter with you what s the matter with you shipmate  in as calm but rapid a manner as possible i gave her to understand the whole case unconsciously clapping the vinegar cruet to one side of her nose she ruminated for an instant then exclaimed no i haven t seen it since i put it there running to a little closet under the landing of the stairs she glanced in and returning told me that queequeg s harpoon was missing he s killed himself she cried it s unfort nate stiggs done over again there goes another counterpane god pity his poor mother it will be the ruin of my house has the poor lad a sister where s that girl there betty go to snarles the painter and tell him to paint me a sign with no suicides permitted here and no smoking in the parlor might as well kill both birds at once kill the lord be merciful to his ghost what s that noise there you young man avast there  and running up after me she caught me as i was again trying to force open the door  i don t allow it i won t have my premises spoiled go for the locksmith there s one about a mile from here but avast putting her hand in her side pocket here s a key that ll fit i guess let s see and with that she turned it in the lock but alas queequeg s supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within  have to burst it open said i and was running down the entry a little for a good start when the landlady caught at me again vowing i should not break down her premises but i tore from her and with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark  with a prodigious noise the door flew open and the knob slamming against the wall sent the plaster to the ceiling and there good heavens there sat queequeg altogether cool and self collected right in the middle of the room squatting on his hams and holding yojo on top of his head he looked neither one way nor the other way but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life  queequeg said i going up to him queequeg what s the matter with you  he hain t been a sittin so all day has he said the landlady  but all we said not a word could we drag out of him i almost felt like pushing him over so as to change his position for it was almost intolerable it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained especially as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours going too without his regular meals  mrs hussey said i he s _alive_ at all events so leave us if you please and i will see to this strange affair myself  closing the door upon the landlady i endeavored to prevail upon queequeg to take a chair but in vain there he sat and all he could do for all my polite arts and blandishments he would not move a peg nor say a single word nor even look at me nor notice my presence in the slightest way  i wonder thought i if this can possibly be a part of his ramadan do they fast on their hams that way in his native island it must be so yes it s part of his creed i suppose well then let him rest he ll get up sooner or later no doubt it can t last for ever thank god and his ramadan only comes once a year and i don t believe it s very punctual then  i went down to supper after sitting a long time listening to the long stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum pudding voyage as they called it that is a short whaling voyage in a schooner or brig confined to the north of the line in the atlantic ocean only after listening to these plum puddingers till nearly eleven o clock i went up stairs to go to bed feeling quite sure by this time queequeg must certainly have brought his ramadan to a termination but no there he was just where i had left him he had not stirred an inch i began to grow vexed with him it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room holding a piece of wood on his head  for heaven s sake queequeg get up and shake yourself get up and have some supper you ll starve you ll kill yourself queequeg but not a word did he reply  despairing of him therefore i determined to go to bed and to sleep and no doubt before a great while he would follow me but previous to turning in i took my heavy bearskin jacket and threw it over him as it promised to be a very cold night and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on for some time do all i would i could not get into the faintest doze i had blown out the candle and the mere thought of queequeg not four feet off sitting there in that uneasy position stark alone in the cold and dark this made me really wretched think of it sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary unaccountable ramadan  but somehow i dropped off at last and knew nothing more till break of day when looking over the bedside there squatted queequeg as if he had been screwed down to the floor but as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the window up he got with stiff and grating joints but with a cheerful look limped towards me where i lay pressed his forehead again against mine and said his ramadan was over  now as i before hinted i have no objection to any person s religion be it what it may so long as that person does not kill or insult any other person because that other person don t believe it also but when a man s religion becomes really frantic when it is a positive torment to him and in fine makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in then i think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the point with him  and just so i now did with queequeg queequeg said i get into bed now and lie and listen to me i then went on beginning with the rise and progress of the primitive religions and coming down to the various religions of the present time during which time i labored to show queequeg that all these lents ramadans and prolonged ham squattings in cold cheerless rooms were stark nonsense bad for the health useless for the soul opposed in short to the obvious laws of hygiene and common sense i told him too that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage it pained me very badly pained me to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous ramadan of his besides argued i fasting makes the body cave in hence the spirit caves in and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half starved this is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters in one word queequeg said i rather digressively hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple dumpling and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by ramadans  i then asked queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia expressing the idea very plainly so that he could take it in he said no only upon one memorable occasion it was after a great feast given by his father the king on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o clock in the afternoon and all cooked and eaten that very evening  no more queequeg said i shuddering that will do for i knew the inferences without his further hinting them i had seen a sailor who had visited that very island and he told me that it was the custom when a great battle had been gained there to barbecue all the slain in the yard or garden of the victor and then one by one they were placed in great wooden trenchers and garnished round like a pilau with breadfruit and cocoanuts and with some parsley in their mouths were sent round with the victor s compliments to all his friends just as though these presents were so many christmas turkeys  after all i do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression upon queequeg because in the first place he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject unless considered from his own point of view and in the second place he did not more than one third understand me couch my ideas simply as i would and finally he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than i did he looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety  at last we rose and dressed and queequeg taking a prodigiously hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts so that the landlady should not make much profit by reason of his ramadan we sallied out to board the pequod sauntering along and picking our teeth with halibut bones
