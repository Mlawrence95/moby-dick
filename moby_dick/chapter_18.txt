chapter 18 his mark  as we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship queequeg carrying his harpoon captain peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft unless they previously produced their papers  what do you mean by that captain peleg said i now jumping on the bulwarks and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf  i mean he replied he must show his papers  yes said captain bildad in his hollow voice sticking his head from behind peleg s out of the wigwam he must show that he s converted son of darkness he added turning to queequeg art thou at present in communion with any christian church  why said i he s a member of the first congregational church here be it said that many tattooed savages sailing in nantucket ships at last come to be converted into the churches  first congregational church cried bildad what that worships in deacon deuteronomy coleman s meeting house and so saying taking out his spectacles he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief and putting them on very carefully came out of the wigwam and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks took a good long look at queequeg  how long hath he been a member he then said turning to me not very long i rather guess young man  no said peleg and he hasn t been baptized right either or it would have washed some of that devil s blue off his face  do tell now cried bildad is this philistine a regular member of deacon deuteronomy s meeting i never saw him going there and i pass it every lord s day  i don t know anything about deacon deuteronomy or his meeting said i all i know is that queequeg here is a born member of the first congregational church he is a deacon himself queequeg is  young man said bildad sternly thou art skylarking with me explain thyself thou young hittite what church dost thee mean answer me  finding myself thus hard pushed i replied i mean sir the same ancient catholic church to which you and i and captain peleg there and queequeg here and all of us and every mother s son and soul of us belong the great and everlasting first congregation of this whole worshipping world we all belong to that only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief in _that_ we all join hands  splice thou mean st _splice_ hands cried peleg drawing nearer young man you d better ship for a missionary instead of a fore mast hand i never heard a better sermon deacon deuteronomy why father mapple himself couldn t beat it and he s reckoned something come aboard come aboard never mind about the papers i say tell quohog there what s that you call him tell quohog to step along by the great anchor what a harpoon he s got there looks like good stuff that and he handles it about right i say quohog or whatever your name is did you ever stand in the head of a whale boat did you ever strike a fish  without saying a word queequeg in his wild sort of way jumped upon the bulwarks from thence into the bows of one of the whale boats hanging to the side and then bracing his left knee and poising his harpoon cried out in some such way as this  cap ain you see him small drop tar on water dere you see him well spose him one whale eye well den and taking sharp aim at it he darted the iron right over old bildad s broad brim clean across the ship s decks and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight  now said queequeg quietly hauling in the line spos ee him whale e eye why dad whale dead  quick bildad said peleg his partner who aghast at the close vicinity of the flying harpoon had retreated towards the cabin gangway quick i say you bildad and get the ship s papers we must have hedgehog there i mean quohog in one of our boats look ye quohog we ll give ye the ninetieth lay and that s more than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of nantucket  so down we went into the cabin and to my great joy queequeg was soon enrolled among the same ship s company to which i myself belonged  when all preliminaries were over and peleg had got everything ready for signing he turned to me and said i guess quohog there don t know how to write does he i say quohog blast ye dost thou sign thy name or make thy mark  but at this question queequeg who had twice or thrice before taken part in similar ceremonies looked no ways abashed but taking the offered pen copied upon the paper in the proper place an exact counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm so that through captain peleg s obstinate mistake touching his appellative it stood something like this  quohog his x mark  meanwhile captain bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing queequeg and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his broad skirted drab coat took out a bundle of tracts and selecting one entitled the latter day coming or no time to lose placed it in queequeg s hands and then grasping them and the book with both his looked earnestly into his eyes and said son of darkness i must do my duty by thee i am part owner of this ship and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew if thou still clingest to thy pagan ways which i sadly fear i beseech thee remain not for aye a belial bondsman spurn the idol bell and the hideous dragon turn from the wrath to come mind thine eye i say oh goodness gracious steer clear of the fiery pit  something of the salt sea yet lingered in old bildad s language heterogeneously mixed with scriptural and domestic phrases  avast there avast there bildad avast now spoiling our harpooneer cried peleg pious harpooneers never make good voyagers it takes the shark out of em no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish there was young nat swaine once the bravest boat header out of all nantucket and the vineyard he joined the meeting and never came to good he got so frightened about his plaguy soul that he shrinked and sheered away from whales for fear of after claps in case he got stove and went to davy jones  peleg peleg said bildad lifting his eyes and hands thou thyself as i myself hast seen many a perilous time thou knowest peleg what it is to have the fear of death how then can st thou prate in this ungodly guise thou beliest thine own heart peleg tell me when this same pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on japan that same voyage when thou went mate with captain ahab did st thou not think of death and the judgment then  hear him hear him now cried peleg marching across the cabin and thrusting his hands far down into his pockets hear him all of ye think of that when every moment we thought the ship would sink death and the judgment then what with all three masts making such an everlasting thundering against the side and every sea breaking over us fore and aft think of death and the judgment then no no time to think about death then life was what captain ahab and i was thinking of and how to save all hands how to rig jury masts how to get into the nearest port that was what i was thinking of  bildad said no more but buttoning up his coat stalked on deck where we followed him there he stood very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who were mending a top sail in the waist now and then he stooped to pick up a patch or save an end of tarred twine which otherwise might have been wasted
