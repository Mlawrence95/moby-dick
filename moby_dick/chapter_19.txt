chapter 19 the prophet  shipmates have ye shipped in that ship  queequeg and i had just left the pequod and were sauntering away from the water for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts when the above words were put to us by a stranger who pausing before us levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question he was but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers a rag of a black handkerchief investing his neck a confluent small pox had in all directions flowed over his face and left it like the complicated ribbed bed of a torrent when the rushing waters have been dried up  have ye shipped in her he repeated  you mean the ship pequod i suppose said i trying to gain a little more time for an uninterrupted look at him  aye the pequod that ship there he said drawing back his whole arm and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him with the fixed bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object  yes said i we have just signed the articles  anything down there about your souls  about what  oh perhaps you hav n t got any he said quickly no matter though i know many chaps that hav n t got any good luck to em and they are all the better off for it a soul s a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon  what are you jabbering about shipmate said i  _he s_ got enough though to make up for all deficiencies of that sort in other chaps abruptly said the stranger placing a nervous emphasis upon the word _he_  queequeg said i let s go this fellow has broken loose from somewhere he s talking about something and somebody we don t know  stop cried the stranger ye said true ye hav n t seen old thunder yet have ye  who s old thunder said i again riveted with the insane earnestness of his manner  captain ahab  what the captain of our ship the pequod  aye among some of us old sailor chaps he goes by that name ye hav n t seen him yet have ye  no we hav n t he s sick they say but is getting better and will be all right again before long  all right again before long laughed the stranger with a solemnly derisive sort of laugh look ye when captain ahab is all right then this left arm of mine will be all right not before  what do you know about him  what did they _tell_ you about him say that  they didn t tell much of anything about him only i ve heard that he s a good whale hunter and a good captain to his crew  that s true that s true yes both true enough but you must jump when he gives an order step and growl growl and go that s the word with captain ahab but nothing about that thing that happened to him off cape horn long ago when he lay like dead for three days and nights nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the spaniard afore the altar in santa heard nothing about that eh nothing about the silver calabash he spat into and nothing about his losing his leg last voyage according to the prophecy didn t ye hear a word about them matters and something more eh no i don t think ye did how could ye who knows it not all nantucket i guess but hows ever mayhap ye ve heard tell about the leg and how he lost it aye ye have heard of that i dare say oh yes _that_ every one knows a most i mean they know he s only one leg and that a parmacetti took the other off  my friend said i what all this gibberish of yours is about i don t know and i don t much care for it seems to me that you must be a little damaged in the head but if you are speaking of captain ahab of that ship there the pequod then let me tell you that i know all about the loss of his leg  _all_ about it eh sure you do all  pretty sure  with finger pointed and eye levelled at the pequod the beggar like stranger stood a moment as if in a troubled reverie then starting a little turned and said ye ve shipped have ye names down on the papers well well what s signed is signed and what s to be will be and then again perhaps it won t be after all anyhow it s all fixed and arranged a ready and some sailors or other must go with him i suppose as well these as any other men god pity em morning to ye shipmates morning the ineffable heavens bless ye i m sorry i stopped ye  look here friend said i if you have anything important to tell us out with it but if you are only trying to bamboozle us you are mistaken in your game that s all i have to say  and it s said very well and i like to hear a chap talk up that way you are just the man for him the likes of ye morning to ye shipmates morning oh when ye get there tell em i ve concluded not to make one of em  ah my dear fellow you can t fool us that way you can t fool us it is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great secret in him  morning to ye shipmates morning  morning it is said i come along queequeg let s leave this crazy man but stop tell me your name will you  elijah  elijah thought i and we walked away both commenting after each other s fashion upon this ragged old sailor and agreed that he was nothing but a humbug trying to be a bugbear but we had not gone perhaps above a hundred yards when chancing to turn a corner and looking back as i did so who should be seen but elijah following us though at a distance somehow the sight of him struck me so that i said nothing to queequeg of his being behind but passed on with my comrade anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner that we did he did and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us but with what intent i could not for the life of me imagine this circumstance coupled with his ambiguous half hinting half revealing shrouded sort of talk now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments and half apprehensions and all connected with the pequod and captain ahab and the leg he had lost and the cape horn fit and the silver calabash and what captain peleg had said of him when i left the ship the day previous and the prediction of the squaw tistig and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail and a hundred other shadowy things  i was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged elijah was really dogging us or not and with that intent crossed the way with queequeg and on that side of it retraced our steps but elijah passed on without seeming to notice us this relieved me and once more and finally as it seemed to me i pronounced him in my heart a humbug
