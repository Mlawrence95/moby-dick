chapter 21 going aboard  it was nearly six o clock but only grey imperfect misty dawn when we drew nigh the wharf  there are some sailors running ahead there if i see right said i to queequeg it can t be shadows she s off by sunrise i guess come on  avast cried a voice whose owner at the same time coming close behind us laid a hand upon both our shoulders and then insinuating himself between us stood stooping forward a little in the uncertain twilight strangely peering from queequeg to me it was elijah  going aboard  hands off will you said i  lookee here said queequeg shaking himself go way  ain t going aboard then  yes we are said i but what business is that of yours do you know mr elijah that i consider you a little impertinent  no no no i wasn t aware of that said elijah slowly and wonderingly looking from me to queequeg with the most unaccountable glances  elijah said i you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing we are going to the indian and pacific oceans and would prefer not to be detained  ye be be ye coming back afore breakfast  he s cracked queequeg said i come on  holloa cried stationary elijah hailing us when we had removed a few paces  never mind him said i queequeg come on  but he stole up to us again and suddenly clapping his hand on my shoulder said did ye see anything looking like men going towards that ship a while ago  struck by this plain matter of fact question i answered saying yes i thought i did see four or five men but it was too dim to be sure  very dim very dim said elijah morning to ye  once more we quitted him but once more he came softly after us and touching my shoulder again said see if you can find em now will ye  find who  morning to ye morning to ye he rejoined again moving off oh i was going to warn ye against but never mind never mind it s all one all in the family too sharp frost this morning ain t it good bye to ye shan t see ye again very soon i guess unless it s before the grand jury and with these cracked words he finally departed leaving me for the moment in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence  at last stepping on board the pequod we found everything in profound quiet not a soul moving the cabin entrance was locked within the hatches were all on and lumbered with coils of rigging going forward to the forecastle we found the slide of the scuttle open seeing a light we went down and found only an old rigger there wrapped in a tattered pea jacket he was thrown at whole length upon two chests his face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms the profoundest slumber slept upon him  those sailors we saw queequeg where can they have gone to said i looking dubiously at the sleeper but it seemed that when on the wharf queequeg had not at all noticed what i now alluded to hence i would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter were it not for elijah s otherwise inexplicable question but i beat the thing down and again marking the sleeper jocularly hinted to queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body telling him to establish himself accordingly he put his hand upon the sleeper s rear as though feeling if it was soft enough and then without more ado sat quietly down there  gracious queequeg don t sit there said i  oh perry dood seat said queequeg my country way won t hurt him face  face said i call that his face very benevolent countenance then but how hard he breathes he s heaving himself get off queequeg you are heavy it s grinding the face of the poor get off queequeg look he ll twitch you off soon i wonder he don t wake  queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper and lighted his tomahawk pipe i sat at the feet we kept the pipe passing over the sleeper from one to the other meanwhile upon questioning him in his broken fashion queequeg gave me to understand that in his land owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts the king chiefs and great people generally were in the custom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans and to furnish a house comfortably in that respect you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows and lay them round in the piers and alcoves besides it was very convenient on an excursion much better than those garden chairs which are convertible into walking sticks upon occasion a chief calling his attendant and desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree perhaps in some damp marshy place  while narrating these things every time queequeg received the tomahawk from me he flourished the hatchet side of it over the sleeper s head  what s that for queequeg  perry easy kill e oh perry easy  he was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk pipe which it seemed had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed his soul when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger the strong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole it began to tell upon him he breathed with a sort of muffledness then seemed troubled in the nose then revolved over once or twice then sat up and rubbed his eyes  holloa he breathed at last who be ye smokers  shipped men answered i when does she sail  aye aye ye are going in her be ye she sails to day the captain came aboard last night  what captain ahab  who but him indeed  i was going to ask him some further questions concerning ahab when we heard a noise on deck  holloa starbuck s astir said the rigger he s a lively chief mate that good man and a pious but all alive now i must turn to and so saying he went on deck and we followed  it was now clear sunrise soon the crew came on board in twos and threes the riggers bestirred themselves the mates were actively engaged and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various last things on board meanwhile captain ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his cabin
