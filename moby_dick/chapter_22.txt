chapter 22 merry christmas  at length towards noon upon the final dismissal of the ship s riggers and after the pequod had been hauled out from the wharf and after the ever thoughtful charity had come off in a whale boat with her last gift a night cap for stubb the second mate her brother in law and a spare bible for the steward after all this the two captains peleg and bildad issued from the cabin and turning to the chief mate peleg said  now mr starbuck are you sure everything is right captain ahab is all ready just spoke to him nothing more to be got from shore eh well call all hands then muster em aft here blast em  no need of profane words however great the hurry peleg said bildad but away with thee friend starbuck and do our bidding  how now here upon the very point of starting for the voyage captain peleg and captain bildad were going it with a high hand on the quarter deck just as if they were to be joint commanders at sea as well as to all appearances in port and as for captain ahab no sign of him was yet to be seen only they said he was in the cabin but then the idea was that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the ship under weigh and steering her well out to sea indeed as that was not at all his proper business but the pilot s and as he was not yet completely recovered so they said therefore captain ahab stayed below and all this seemed natural enough especially as in the merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the anchor but remain over the cabin table having a farewell merry making with their shore friends before they quit the ship for good with the pilot  but there was not much chance to think over the matter for captain peleg was now all alive he seemed to do most of the talking and commanding and not bildad  aft here ye sons of bachelors he cried as the sailors lingered at the main mast mr starbuck drive em aft  strike the tent there was the next order as i hinted before this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port and on board the pequod for thirty years the order to strike the tent was well known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor  man the capstan blood and thunder jump was the next command and the crew sprang for the handspikes  now in getting under weigh the station generally occupied by the pilot is the forward part of the ship and here bildad who with peleg be it known in addition to his other officers was one of the licensed pilots of the port he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the nantucket pilot fee to all the ships he was concerned in for he never piloted any other craft bildad i say might now be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody to cheer the hands at the windlass who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in booble alley with hearty good will nevertheless not three days previous bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed on board the pequod particularly in getting under weigh and charity his sister had placed a small choice copy of watts in each seaman s berth  meantime overseeing the other part of the ship captain peleg ripped and swore astern in the most frightful manner i almost thought he would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up involuntarily i paused on my handspike and told queequeg to do the same thinking of the perils we both ran in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot i was comforting myself however with the thought that in pious bildad might be found some salvation spite of his seven hundred and seventy seventh lay when i felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear and turning round was horrified at the apparition of captain peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity that was my first kick  is that the way they heave in the marchant service he roared spring thou sheep head spring and break thy backbone why don t ye spring i say all of ye spring quohog spring thou chap with the red whiskers spring there scotch cap spring thou green pants spring i say all of ye and spring your eyes out and so saying he moved along the windlass here and there using his leg very freely while imperturbable bildad kept leading off with his psalmody thinks i captain peleg must have been drinking something to day  at last the anchor was up the sails were set and off we glided it was a short cold christmas and as the short northern day merged into night we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean whose freezing spray cased us in ice as in polished armor the long rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight and like the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant vast curving icicles depended from the bows  lank bildad as pilot headed the first watch and ever and anon as the old craft deep dived into the green seas and sent the shivering frost all over her and the winds howled and the cordage rang his steady notes were heard   _ sweet fields beyond the swelling flood stand dressed in living green so to the jews old canaan stood while jordan rolled between _    never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then they were full of hope and fruition spite of this frigid winter night in the boisterous atlantic spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket there was yet it then seemed to me many a pleasant haven in store and meads and glades so eternally vernal that the grass shot up by the spring untrodden unwilted remains at midsummer  at last we gained such an offing that the two pilots were needed no longer the stout sail boat that had accompanied us began ranging alongside  it was curious and not unpleasing how peleg and bildad were affected at this juncture especially captain bildad for loath to depart yet very loath to leave for good a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage beyond both stormy capes a ship in which some thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested a ship in which an old shipmate sailed as captain a man almost as old as he once more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw loath to say good bye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him poor old bildad lingered long paced the deck with anxious strides ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word there again came on deck and looked to windward looked towards the wide and endless waters only bounded by the far off unseen eastern continents looked towards the land looked aloft looked right and left looked everywhere and nowhere and at last mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin convulsively grasped stout peleg by the hand and holding up a lantern for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face as much as to say nevertheless friend peleg i can stand it yes i can  as for peleg himself he took it more like a philosopher but for all his philosophy there was a tear twinkling in his eye when the lantern came too near and he too did not a little run from cabin to deck now a word below and now a word with starbuck the chief mate  but at last he turned to his comrade with a final sort of look about him captain bildad come old shipmate we must go back the main yard there boat ahoy stand by to come close alongside now careful careful come bildad boy say your last luck to ye starbuck luck to ye mr stubb luck to ye mr flask good bye and good luck to ye all and this day three years i ll have a hot supper smoking for ye in old nantucket hurrah and away  god bless ye and have ye in his holy keeping men murmured old bildad almost incoherently i hope ye ll have fine weather now so that captain ahab may soon be moving among ye a pleasant sun is all he needs and ye ll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go be careful in the hunt ye mates don t stave the boats needlessly ye harpooneers good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent within the year don t forget your prayers either mr starbuck mind that cooper don t waste the spare staves oh the sail needles are in the green locker don t whale it too much a lord s days men but don t miss a fair chance either that s rejecting heaven s good gifts have an eye to the molasses tierce mr stubb it was a little leaky i thought if ye touch at the islands mr flask beware of fornication good bye good bye don t keep that cheese too long down in the hold mr starbuck it ll spoil be careful with the butter twenty cents the pound it was and mind ye if  come come captain bildad stop palavering away and with that peleg hurried him over the side and both dropt into the boat  ship and boat diverged the cold damp night breeze blew between a screaming gull flew overhead the two hulls wildly rolled we gave three heavy hearted cheers and blindly plunged like fate into the lone atlantic
