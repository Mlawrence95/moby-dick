chapter 23 the lee shore  some chapters back one bulkington was spoken of a tall newlanded mariner encountered in new bedford at the inn  when on that shivering winter s night the pequod thrust her vindictive bows into the cold malicious waves who should i see standing at her helm but bulkington i looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man who in mid winter just landed from a four years dangerous voyage could so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term the land seemed scorching to his feet wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable deep memories yield no epitaphs this six inch chapter is the stoneless grave of bulkington let me only say that it fared with him as with the storm tossed ship that miserably drives along the leeward land the port would fain give succor the port is pitiful in the port is safety comfort hearthstone supper warm blankets friends all that s kind to our mortalities but in that gale the port the land is that ship s direst jeopardy she must fly all hospitality one touch of land though it but graze the keel would make her shudder through and through with all her might she crowds all sail off shore in so doing fights gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward seeks all the lashed sea s landlessness again for refuge s sake forlornly rushing into peril her only friend her bitterest foe  know ye now bulkington glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth that all deep earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous slavish shore  but as in landlessness alone resides highest truth shoreless indefinite as god so better is it to perish in that howling infinite than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee even if that were safety for worm like then oh who would craven crawl to land terrors of the terrible is all this agony so vain take heart take heart o bulkington bear thee grimly demigod up from the spray of thy ocean perishing straight up leaps thy apotheosis
