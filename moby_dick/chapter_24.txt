chapter 24 the advocate  as queequeg and i are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit therefore i am all anxiety to convince ye ye landsmen of the injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales  in the first place it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish the fact that among people at large the business of whaling is not accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions if a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits were he presented to the company as a harpooneer say and if in emulation of the naval officers he should append the initials s w f sperm whale fishery to his visiting card such a procedure would be deemed pre eminently presuming and ridiculous  doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us whalemen is this they think that at best our vocation amounts to a butchering sort of business and that when actively engaged therein we are surrounded by all manner of defilements butchers we are that is true but butchers also and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been all martial commanders whom the world invariably delights to honor and as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business ye shall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown and which upon the whole will triumphantly plant the sperm whale ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth but even granting the charge in question to be true what disordered slippery decks of a whale ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battle fields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies plaudits and if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of the soldier s profession let me assure ye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery would quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale s vast tail fanning into eddies the air over his head for what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of god  but though the world scouts at us whale hunters yet does it unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage yea an all abounding adoration for almost all the tapers lamps and candles that burn round the globe burn as before so many shrines to our glory  but look at this matter in other lights weigh it in all sorts of scales see what we whalemen are and have been  why did the dutch in de witt s time have admirals of their whaling fleets why did louis xvi of france at his own personal expense fit out whaling ships from dunkirk and politely invite to that town some score or two of families from our own island of nantucket why did britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of 1 000 000 and lastly how comes it that we whalemen of america now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels manned by eighteen thousand men yearly consuming 4 000 000 of dollars the ships worth at the time of sailing 20 000 000 and every year importing into our harbors a well reaped harvest of 7 000 000 how comes all this if there be not something puissant in whaling  but this is not the half look again  i freely assert that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot for his life point out one single peaceful influence which within the last sixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world taken in one aggregate than the high and mighty business of whaling one way and another it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves and so continuously momentous in their sequential issues that whaling may well be regarded as that egyptian mother who bore offspring themselves pregnant from her womb it would be a hopeless endless task to catalogue all these things let a handful suffice for many years past the whale ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least known parts of the earth she has explored seas and archipelagoes which had no chart where no cook or vancouver had ever sailed if american and european men of war now peacefully ride in once savage harbors let them fire salutes to the honor and glory of the whale ship which originally showed them the way and first interpreted between them and the savages they may celebrate as they will the heroes of exploring expeditions your cooks your krusensterns but i say that scores of anonymous captains have sailed out of nantucket that were as great and greater than your cook and your krusenstern for in their succourless empty handedness they in the heathenish sharked waters and by the beaches of unrecorded javelin islands battled with virgin wonders and terrors that cook with all his marines and muskets would not willingly have dared all that is made such a flourish of in the old south sea voyages those things were but the life time commonplaces of our heroic nantucketers often adventures which vancouver dedicates three chapters to these men accounted unworthy of being set down in the ship s common log ah the world oh the world  until the whale fishery rounded cape horn no commerce but colonial scarcely any intercourse but colonial was carried on between europe and the long line of the opulent spanish provinces on the pacific coast it was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the spanish crown touching those colonies and if space permitted it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the liberation of peru chili and bolivia from the yoke of old spain and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts  that great america on the other side of the sphere australia was given to the enlightened world by the whaleman after its first blunder born discovery by a dutchman all other ships long shunned those shores as pestiferously barbarous but the whale ship touched there the whale ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony moreover in the infancy of the first australian settlement the emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whale ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters the uncounted isles of all polynesia confess the same truth and do commercial homage to the whale ship that cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations if that double bolted land japan is ever to become hospitable it is the whale ship alone to whom the credit will be due for already she is on the threshold  but if in the face of all this you still declare that whaling has no Ã¦sthetically noble associations connected with it then am i ready to shiver fifty lances with you there and unhorse you with a split helmet every time  the whale has no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler you will say  _the whale no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler _ who wrote the first account of our leviathan who but mighty job and who composed the first narrative of a whaling voyage who but no less a prince than alfred the great who with his own royal pen took down the words from other the norwegian whale hunter of those times and who pronounced our glowing eulogy in parliament who but edmund burke  true enough but then whalemen themselves are poor devils they have no good blood in their veins  _no good blood in their veins _ they have something better than royal blood there the grandmother of benjamin franklin was mary morrel afterwards by marriage mary folger one of the old settlers of nantucket and the ancestress to a long line of folgers and harpooneers all kith and kin to noble benjamin this day darting the barbed iron from one side of the world to the other  good again but then all confess that somehow whaling is not respectable  _whaling not respectable _ whaling is imperial by old english statutory law the whale is declared a royal fish  oh that s only nominal the whale himself has never figured in any grand imposing way  _the whale never figured in any grand imposing way _ in one of the mighty triumphs given to a roman general upon his entering the world s capital the bones of a whale brought all the way from the syrian coast were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed procession  see subsequent chapters for something more on this head  grant it since you cite it but say what you will there is no real dignity in whaling  _no dignity in whaling _ the dignity of our calling the very heavens attest cetus is a constellation in the south no more drive down your hat in presence of the czar and take it off to queequeg no more i know a man that in his lifetime has taken three hundred and fifty whales i account that man more honorable than that great captain of antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns  and as for me if by any possibility there be any as yet undiscovered prime thing in me if i shall ever deserve any real repute in that small but high hushed world which i might not be unreasonably ambitious of if hereafter i shall do anything that upon the whole a man might rather have done than to have left undone if at my death my executors or more properly my creditors find any precious mss in my desk then here i prospectively ascribe all the honor and the glory to whaling for a whale ship was my yale college and my harvard
