chapter of sounds yet for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude there were certain qualities in him which at times affected and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest uncommonly conscientious for a seaman and endued with a deep natural reverence the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition but to that sort of superstition which in some organizations seems rather to spring somehow from intelligence than from ignorance outward portents and inward presentiments were his and if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul much more did his far away domestic memories of his young cape wife and child tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature and open him still further to those latent influences which in some honest hearted men restrain the gush of dare devil daring so often evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery i will have no man in my boat said starbuck who is not afraid of a whale by this he seemed to mean not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward  aye aye said stubb the second mate starbuck there is as careful a man as you ll find anywhere in this fishery but we shall ere long see what that word careful precisely means when used by a man like stubb or almost any other whale hunter  starbuck was no crusader after perils in him courage was not a sentiment but a thing simply useful to him and always at hand upon all mortally practical occasions besides he thought perhaps that in this business of whaling courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship like her beef and her bread and not to be foolishly wasted wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sun down nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him for thought starbuck i am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living and not to be killed by them for theirs and that hundreds of men had been so killed starbuck well knew what doom was his own father s where in the bottomless deeps could he find the torn limbs of his brother  with memories like these in him and moreover given to a certain superstitiousness as has been said the courage of this starbuck which could nevertheless still flourish must indeed have been extreme but it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he had it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently engendering an element in him which under suitable circumstances would break out from its confinement and burn all his courage up and brave as he might be it was that sort of bravery chiefly visible in some intrepid men which while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas or winds or whales or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world yet cannot withstand those more terrific because more spiritual terrors which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man  but were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance the complete abasement of poor starbuck s fortitude scarce might i have the heart to write it for it is a thing most sorrowful nay shocking to expose the fall of valour in the soul men may seem detestable as joint stock companies and nations knaves fools and murderers there may be men may have mean and meagre faces but man in the ideal is so noble and so sparkling such a grand and glowing creature that over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their costliest robes that immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves so far within us that it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valor ruined man nor can piety itself at such a shameful sight completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars but this august dignity i treat of is not the dignity of kings and robes but that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike that democratic dignity which on all hands radiates without end from god himself the great god absolute the centre and circumference of all democracy his omnipresence our divine equality  if then to meanest mariners and renegades and castaways i shall hereafter ascribe high qualities though dark weave round them tragic graces if even the most mournful perchance the most abased among them all shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts if i shall touch that workman s arm with some ethereal light if i shall spread a rainbow over his disastrous set of sun then against all mortal critics bear me out in it thou just spirit of equality which hast spread one royal mantle of humanity over all my kind bear me out in it thou great democratic god who didst not refuse to the swart convict bunyan the pale poetic pearl thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of finest gold the stumped and paupered arm of old cervantes thou who didst pick up andrew jackson from the pebbles who didst hurl him upon a war horse who didst thunder him higher than a throne thou who in all thy mighty earthly marchings ever cullest thy selectest champions from the kingly commons bear me out in it o god
