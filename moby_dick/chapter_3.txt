chapter 3 the spouter inn  entering that gable ended spouter inn you found yourself in a wide low straggling entry with old fashioned wainscots reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft on one side hung a very large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked and every way defaced that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it and careful inquiry of the neighbors that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist in the time of the new england hags had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched but by dint of much and earnest contemplation and oft repeated ponderings and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea however wild might not be altogether unwarranted  but what most puzzled and confounded you was a long limber portentous black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue dim perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast a boggy soggy squitchy picture truly enough to drive a nervous man distracted yet was there a sort of indefinite half attained unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant ever and anon a bright but alas deceptive idea would dart you through it s the black sea in a midnight gale it s the unnatural combat of the four primal elements it s a blasted heath it s a hyperborean winter scene it s the breaking up of the icebound stream of time but at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the picture s midst _that_ once found out and all the rest were plain but stop does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish even the great leviathan himself  in fact the artist s design seemed this a final theory of my own partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom i conversed upon the subject the picture represents a cape horner in a great hurricane the half foundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible and an exasperated whale purposing to spring clean over the craft is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast heads  the opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws others were tufted with knots of human hair and one was sickle shaped with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the new mown grass by a long armed mower you shuddered as you gazed and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death harvesting with such a hacking horrifying implement mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed some were storied weapons with this once long lance now wildly elbowed fifty years ago did nathan swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset and that harpoon so like a corkscrew now was flung in javan seas and run away with by a whale years afterwards slain off the cape of blanco the original iron entered nigh the tail and like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man travelled full forty feet and at last was found imbedded in the hump  crossing this dusky entry and on through yon low arched way cut through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with fireplaces all round you enter the public room a still duskier place is this with such low ponderous beams above and such old wrinkled planks beneath that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft s cockpits especially of such a howling night when this corner anchored old ark rocked so furiously on one side stood a long low shelf like table covered with cracked glass cases filled with dusty rarities gathered from this wide world s remotest nooks projecting from the further angle of the room stands a dark looking den the bar a rude attempt at a right whale s head be that how it may there stands the vast arched bone of the whale s jaw so wide a coach might almost drive beneath it within are shabby shelves ranged round with old decanters bottles flasks and in those jaws of swift destruction like another cursed jonah by which name indeed they called him bustles a little withered old man who for their money dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death  abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison though true cylinders without within the villanous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom parallel meridians rudely pecked into the glass surround these footpads goblets fill to _this_ mark and your charge is but a penny to _this_ a penny more and so on to the full glass the cape horn measure which you may gulp down for a shilling  upon entering the place i found a number of young seamen gathered about a table examining by a dim light divers specimens of _skrimshander_ i sought the landlord and telling him i desired to be accommodated with a room received for answer that his house was full not a bed unoccupied but avast he added tapping his forehead you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer s blanket have ye i s pose you are goin a whalin so you d better get used to that sort of thing  i told him that i never liked to sleep two in a bed that if i should ever do so it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be and that if he the landlord really had no other place for me and the harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable why rather than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night i would put up with the half of any decent man s blanket  i thought so all right take a seat supper you want supper supper ll be ready directly  i sat down on an old wooden settle carved all over like a bench on the battery at one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with his jack knife stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his legs he was trying his hand at a ship under full sail but he didn t make much headway i thought  at last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room it was cold as iceland no fire at all the landlord said he couldn t afford it nothing but two dismal tallow candles each in a winding sheet we were fain to button up our monkey jackets and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers but the fare was of the most substantial kind not only meat and potatoes but dumplings good heavens dumplings for supper one young fellow in a green box coat addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner  my boy said the landlord you ll have the nightmare to a dead sartainty  landlord i whispered that aint the harpooneer is it  oh no said he looking a sort of diabolically funny the harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap he never eats dumplings he don t he eats nothing but steaks and he likes em rare  the devil he does says i where is that harpooneer is he here  he ll be here afore long was the answer  i could not help it but i began to feel suspicious of this dark complexioned harpooneer at any rate i made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together he must undress and get into bed before i did  supper over the company went back to the bar room when knowing not what else to do with myself i resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a looker on  presently a rioting noise was heard without starting up the landlord cried that s the grampus s crew i seed her reported in the offing this morning a three years voyage and a full ship hurrah boys now we ll have the latest news from the feegees  a tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry the door was flung open and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough enveloped in their shaggy watch coats and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters all bedarned and ragged and their beards stiff with icicles they seemed an eruption of bears from labrador they had just landed from their boat and this was the first house they entered no wonder then that they made a straight wake for the whale s mouth the bar when the wrinkled little old jonah there officiating soon poured them out brimmers all round one complained of a bad cold in his head upon which jonah mixed him a pitch like potion of gin and molasses which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever never mind of how long standing or whether caught off the coast of labrador or on the weather side of an ice island  the liquor soon mounted into their heads as it generally does even with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea and they began capering about most obstreperously  i observed however that one of them held somewhat aloof and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest this man interested me at once and since the sea gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate though but a sleeping partner one so far as this narrative is concerned i will here venture upon a little description of him he stood full six feet in height with noble shoulders and a chest like a coffer dam i have seldom seen such brawn in a man his face was deeply brown and burnt making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy his voice at once announced that he was a southerner and from his fine stature i thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the alleghanian ridge in virginia when the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height this man slipped away unobserved and i saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea in a few minutes however he was missed by his shipmates and being it seems for some reason a huge favourite with them they raised a cry of bulkington bulkington where s bulkington and darted out of the house in pursuit of him  it was now about nine o clock and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgies i began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen  no man prefers to sleep two in a bed in fact you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother i don t know how it is but people like to be private when they are sleeping and when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger in a strange inn in a strange town and that stranger a harpooneer then your objections indefinitely multiply nor was there any earthly reason why i as a sailor should sleep two in a bed more than anybody else for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea than bachelor kings do ashore to be sure they all sleep together in one apartment but you have your own hammock and cover yourself with your own blanket and sleep in your own skin  the more i pondered over this harpooneer the more i abominated the thought of sleeping with him it was fair to presume that being a harpooneer his linen or woollen as the case might be would not be of the tidiest certainly none of the finest i began to twitch all over besides it was getting late and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards suppose now he should tumble in upon me at midnight how could i tell from what vile hole he had been coming  landlord i ve changed my mind about that harpooneer i shan t sleep with him i ll try the bench here  just as you please i m sorry i can t spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress and it s a plaguy rough board here feeling of the knots and notches but wait a bit skrimshander i ve got a carpenter s plane there in the bar wait i say and i ll make ye snug enough so saying he procured the plane and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench vigorously set to planing away at my bed the while grinning like an ape the shavings flew right and left till at last the plane iron came bump against an indestructible knot the landlord was near spraining his wrist and i told him for heaven s sake to quit the bed was soft enough to suit me and i did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank so gathering up the shavings with another grin and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room he went about his business and left me in a brown study  i now took the measure of the bench and found that it was a foot too short but that could be mended with a chair but it was a foot too narrow and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed one so there was no yoking them i then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall leaving a little interval between for my back to settle down in but i soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window that this plan would never do at all especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where i had thought to spend the night  the devil fetch that harpooneer thought i but stop couldn t i steal a march on him bolt his door inside and jump into his bed not to be wakened by the most violent knockings it seemed no bad idea but upon second thoughts i dismissed it for who could tell but what the next morning so soon as i popped out of the room the harpooneer might be standing in the entry all ready to knock me down  still looking round me again and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other person s bed i began to think that after all i might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown harpooneer thinks i i ll wait awhile he must be dropping in before long i ll have a good look at him then and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after all there s no telling  but though the other boarders kept coming in by ones twos and threes and going to bed yet no sign of my harpooneer  landlord said i what sort of a chap is he does he always keep such late hours it was now hard upon twelve o clock  the landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension no he answered generally he s an early bird airley to bed and airley to rise yes he s the bird what catches the worm but to night he went out a peddling you see and i don t see what on airth keeps him so late unless may be he can t sell his head  can t sell his head what sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me getting into a towering rage do you pretend to say landlord that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed saturday night or rather sunday morning in peddling his head around this town  that s precisely it said the landlord and i told him he couldn t sell it here the market s overstocked  with what shouted i  with heads to be sure ain t there too many heads in the world  i tell you what it is landlord said i quite calmly you d better stop spinning that yarn to me i m not green  may be not taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick but i rayther guess you ll be done _brown_ if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin his head  i ll break it for him said i now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord s  it s broke a ready said he  broke said i _broke_ do you mean  sartain and that s the very reason he can t sell it i guess  landlord said i going up to him as cool as mt hecla in a snow storm landlord stop whittling you and i must understand one another and that too without delay i come to your house and want a bed you tell me you can only give me half a one that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer and about this harpooneer whom i have not yet seen you persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow a sort of connexion landlord which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest degree i now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is and whether i shall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him and in the first place you will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head which if true i take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad and i ve no idea of sleeping with a madman and you sir _you_ i mean landlord _you_ sir by trying to induce me to do so knowingly would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution  wall said the landlord fetching a long breath that s a purty long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then but be easy be easy this here harpooneer i have been tellin you of has just arrived from the south seas where he bought up a lot of balmed new zealand heads great curios you know and he s sold all on em but one and that one he s trying to sell to night cause to morrow s sunday and it would not do to be sellin human heads about the streets when folks is goin to churches he wanted to last sunday but i stopped him just as he was goin out of the door with four heads strung on a string for all the airth like a string of inions  this account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery and showed that the landlord after all had had no idea of fooling me but at the same time what could i think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a saturday night clean into the holy sabbath engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators  depend upon it landlord that harpooneer is a dangerous man  he pays reg lar was the rejoinder but come it s getting dreadful late you had better be turning flukes it s a nice bed sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced there s plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed it s an almighty big bed that why afore we give it up sal used to put our sam and little johnny in the foot of it but i got a dreaming and sprawling about one night and somehow sam got pitched on the floor and came near breaking his arm arter that sal said it wouldn t do come along here i ll give ye a glim in a jiffy and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me offering to lead the way but i stood irresolute when looking at a clock in the corner he exclaimed i vum it s sunday you won t see that harpooneer to night he s come to anchor somewhere come along then _do_ come _won t_ ye come  i considered the matter a moment and then up stairs we went and i was ushered into a small room cold as a clam and furnished sure enough with a prodigious bed almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast  there said the landlord placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty as a wash stand and centre table there make yourself comfortable now and good night to ye i turned round from eyeing the bed but he had disappeared  folding back the counterpane i stooped over the bed though none of the most elegant it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well i then glanced round the room and besides the bedstead and centre table could see no other furniture belonging to the place but a rude shelf the four walls and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale of things not properly belonging to the room there was a hammock lashed up and thrown upon the floor in one corner also a large seaman s bag containing the harpooneer s wardrobe no doubt in lieu of a land trunk likewise there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire place and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed  but what is this on the chest i took it up and held it close to the light and felt it and smelt it and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it i can compare it to nothing but a large door mat ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an indian moccasin there was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat as you see the same in south american ponchos but could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat and parade the streets of any christian town in that sort of guise i put it on to try it and it weighed me down like a hamper being uncommonly shaggy and thick and i thought a little damp as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day i went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall and i never saw such a sight in my life i tore myself out of it in such a hurry that i gave myself a kink in the neck  i sat down on the side of the bed and commenced thinking about this head peddling harpooneer and his door mat after thinking some time on the bed side i got up and took off my monkey jacket and then stood in the middle of the room thinking i then took off my coat and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves but beginning to feel very cold now half undressed as i was and remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer s not coming home at all that night it being so very late i made no more ado but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed and commended myself to the care of heaven  whether that mattress was stuffed with corn cobs or broken crockery there is no telling but i rolled about a good deal and could not sleep for a long time at last i slid off into a light doze and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of nod when i heard a heavy footfall in the passage and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door  lord save me thinks i that must be the harpooneer the infernal head peddler but i lay perfectly still and resolved not to say a word till spoken to holding a light in one hand and that identical new zealand head in the other the stranger entered the room and without looking towards the bed placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag i before spoke of as being in the room i was all eagerness to see his face but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bag s mouth this accomplished however he turned round when good heavens what a sight such a face it was of a dark purplish yellow colour here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares yes it s just as i thought he s a terrible bedfellow he s been in a fight got dreadfully cut and here he is just from the surgeon but at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light that i plainly saw they could not be sticking plasters at all those black squares on his cheeks they were stains of some sort or other at first i knew not what to make of this but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me i remembered a story of a white man a whaleman too who falling among the cannibals had been tattooed by them i concluded that this harpooneer in the course of his distant voyages must have met with a similar adventure and what is it thought i after all it s only his outside a man can be honest in any sort of skin but then what to make of his unearthly complexion that part of it i mean lying round about and completely independent of the squares of tattooing to be sure it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning but i never heard of a hot sun s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one however i had never been in the south seas and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin now while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning this harpooneer never noticed me at all but after some difficulty having opened his bag he commenced fumbling in it and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk and a seal skin wallet with the hair on placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room he then took the new zealand head a ghastly thing enough and crammed it down into the bag he now took off his hat a new beaver hat when i came nigh singing out with fresh surprise there was no hair on his head none to speak of at least nothing but a small scalp knot twisted up on his forehead his bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull had not the stranger stood between me and the door i would have bolted out of it quicker than ever i bolted a dinner  even as it was i thought something of slipping out of the window but it was the second floor back i am no coward but what to make of this head peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension ignorance is the parent of fear and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger i confess i was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night in fact i was so afraid of him that i was not game enough just then to address him and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him  meanwhile he continued the business of undressing and at last showed his chest and arms as i live these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face his back too was all over the same dark squares he seemed to have been in a thirty years war and just escaped from it with a sticking plaster shirt still more his very legs were marked as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms it was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the south seas and so landed in this christian country i quaked to think of it a peddler of heads too perhaps the heads of his own brothers he might take a fancy to mine heavens look at that tomahawk  but there was no time for shuddering for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen going to his heavy grego or wrapall or dreadnaught which he had previously hung on a chair he fumbled in the pockets and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back and exactly the colour of a three days old congo baby remembering the embalmed head at first i almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner but seeing that it was not at all limber and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony i concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol which indeed it proved to be for now the savage goes up to the empty fire place and removing the papered fire board sets up this little hunch backed image like a tenpin between the andirons the chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty so that i thought this fire place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his congo idol  i now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image feeling but ill at ease meantime to see what was next to follow first he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket and places them carefully before the idol then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze presently after many hasty snatches into the fire and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit then blowing off the heat and ashes a little he made a polite offer of it to the little negro but the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all he never moved his lips all these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee who seemed to be praying in a sing song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner at last extinguishing the fire he took the idol up very unceremoniously and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock  all these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations and jumping into bed with me i thought it was high time now or never before the light was put out to break the spell in which i had so long been bound  but the interval i spent in deliberating what to say was a fatal one taking up his tomahawk from the table he examined the head of it for an instant and then holding it to the light with his mouth at the handle he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke the next moment the light was extinguished and this wild cannibal tomahawk between his teeth sprang into bed with me i sang out i could not help it now and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me  stammering out something i knew not what i rolled away from him against the wall and then conjured him whoever or whatever he might be to keep quiet and let me get up and light the lamp again but his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning  who e debel you he at last said you no speak e dam me i kill e and so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark  landlord for god s sake peter coffin shouted i landlord watch coffin angels save me  speak e tell ee me who ee be or dam me i kill e again growled the cannibal while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till i thought my linen would get on fire but thank heaven at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand and leaping from the bed i ran up to him  don t be afraid now said he grinning again queequeg here wouldn t harm a hair of your head  stop your grinning shouted i and why didn t you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal  i thought ye know d it didn t i tell ye he was a peddlin heads around town but turn flukes again and go to sleep queequeg look here you sabbee me i sabbee you this man sleepe you you sabbee  me sabbee plenty grunted queequeg puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed  you gettee in he added motioning to me with his tomahawk and throwing the clothes to one side he really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way i stood looking at him a moment for all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean comely looking cannibal what s all this fuss i have been making about thought i to myself the man s a human being just as i am he has just as much reason to fear me as i have to be afraid of him better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken christian  landlord said i tell him to stash his tomahawk there or pipe or whatever you call it tell him to stop smoking in short and i will turn in with him but i don t fancy having a man smoking in bed with me it s dangerous besides i ain t insured  this being told to queequeg he at once complied and again politely motioned me to get into bed rolling over to one side as much as to say i won t touch a leg of ye  good night landlord said i you may go  i turned in and never slept better in my life
