chapter 29 enter ahab to him stubb  some days elapsed and ice and icebergs all astern the pequod now went rolling through the bright quito spring which at sea almost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal august of the tropic the warmly cool clear ringing perfumed overflowing redundant days were as crystal goblets of persian sherbet heaped up flaked up with rose water snow the starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets nursing at home in lonely pride the memory of their absent conquering earls the golden helmeted suns for sleeping man twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights but all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward world inward they turned upon the soul especially when the still mild hours of eve came on then memory shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights and all these subtle agencies more and more they wrought on ahab s texture  old age is always wakeful as if the longer linked with life the less man has to do with aught that looks like death among sea commanders the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the night cloaked deck it was so with ahab only that now of late he seemed so much to live in the open air that truly speaking his visits were more to the cabin than from the cabin to the planks it feels like going down into one s tomb he would mutter to himself for an old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle to go to my grave dug berth  so almost every twenty four hours when the watches of the night were set and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle the sailors flung it not rudely down as by day but with some cautiousness dropt it to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates when this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail habitually the silent steersman would watch the cabin scuttle and ere long the old man would emerge gripping at the iron banister to help his crippled way some considering touch of humanity was in him for at times like these he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter deck because to his wearied mates seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks but once the mood was on him too deep for common regardings and as with heavy lumber like pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast stubb the old second mate came up from below with a certain unassured deprecating humorousness hinted that if captain ahab was pleased to walk the planks then no one could say nay but there might be some way of muffling the noise hinting something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow and the insertion into it of the ivory heel ah stubb thou didst not know ahab then  am i a cannon ball stubb said ahab that thou wouldst wad me that fashion but go thy ways i had forgot below to thy nightly grave where such as ye sleep between shrouds to use ye to the filling one at last down dog and kennel  starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly scornful old man stubb was speechless a moment then said excitedly i am not used to be spoken to that way sir i do but less than half like it sir  avast gritted ahab between his set teeth and violently moving away as if to avoid some passionate temptation  no sir not yet said stubb emboldened i will not tamely be called a dog sir  then be called ten times a donkey and a mule and an ass and begone or i ll clear the world of thee  as he said this ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in his aspect that stubb involuntarily retreated  i was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it muttered stubb as he found himself descending the cabin scuttle it s very queer stop stubb somehow now i don t well know whether to go back and strike him or what s that down here on my knees and pray for him yes that was the thought coming up in me but it would be the first time i ever _did_ pray it s queer very queer and he s queer too aye take him fore and aft he s about the queerest old man stubb ever sailed with how he flashed at me his eyes like powder pans is he mad anyway there s something on his mind as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks he aint in his bed now either more than three hours out of the twenty four and he don t sleep then didn t that dough boy the steward tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man s hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled and the sheets down at the foot and the coverlid almost tied into knots and the pillow a sort of frightful hot as though a baked brick had been on it a hot old man i guess he s got what some folks ashore call a conscience it s a kind of tic dolly row they say worse nor a toothache well well i don t know what it is but the lord keep me from catching it he s full of riddles i wonder what he goes into the after hold for every night as dough boy tells me he suspects what s that for i should like to know who s made appointments with him in the hold ain t that queer now but there s no telling it s the old game here goes for a snooze damn me it s worth a fellow s while to be born into the world if only to fall right asleep and now that i think of it that s about the first thing babies do and that s a sort of queer too damn me but all things are queer come to think of em but that s against my principles think not is my eleventh commandment and sleep when you can is my twelfth so here goes again but how s that didn t he call me a dog blazes he called me ten times a donkey and piled a lot of jackasses on top of _that _ he might as well have kicked me and done with it maybe he _did_ kick me and i didn t observe it i was so taken all aback with his brow somehow it flashed like a bleached bone what the devil s the matter with me i don t stand right on my legs coming afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out by the lord i must have been dreaming though how how how but the only way s to stash it so here goes to hammock again and in the morning i ll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by daylight
