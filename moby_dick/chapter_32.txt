chapter 31 queen mab  next morning stubb accosted flask  such a queer dream king post i never had you know the old man s ivory leg well i dreamed he kicked me with it and when i tried to kick back upon my soul my little man i kicked my leg right off and then presto ahab seemed a pyramid and i like a blazing fool kept kicking at it but what was still more curious flask you know how curious all dreams are through all this rage that i was in i somehow seemed to be thinking to myself that after all it was not much of an insult that kick from ahab why thinks i what s the row it s not a real leg only a false leg and there s a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump that s what makes a blow from the hand flask fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane the living member that makes the living insult my little man and thinks i to myself all the while mind while i was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid so confoundedly contradictory was it all all the while i say i was thinking to myself what s his leg now but a cane a whalebone cane yes thinks i it was only a playful cudgelling in fact only a whaleboning that he gave me not a base kick besides thinks i look at it once why the end of it the foot part what a small sort of end it is whereas if a broad footed farmer kicked me _there s_ a devilish broad insult but this insult is whittled down to a point only but now comes the greatest joke of the dream flask while i was battering away at the pyramid a sort of badger haired old merman with a hump on his back takes me by the shoulders and slews me round what are you bout says he slid man but i was frightened such a phiz but somehow next moment i was over the fright what am i about says i at last and what business is that of yours i should like to know mr humpback do _you_ want a kick by the lord flask i had no sooner said that than he turned round his stern to me bent over and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout what do you think i saw why thunder alive man his stern was stuck full of marlinspikes with the points out says i on second thoughts i guess i won t kick you old fellow wise stubb said he wise stubb and kept muttering it all the time a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag seeing he wasn t going to stop saying over his wise stubb wise stubb i thought i might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again but i had only just lifted my foot for it when he roared out stop that kicking halloa says i what s the matter now old fellow look ye here says he let s argue the insult captain ahab kicked ye didn t he yes he did says i right _here_ it was very good says he he used his ivory leg didn t he yes he did says i well then says he wise stubb what have you to complain of didn t he kick with right good will it wasn t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with was it no you were kicked by a great man and with a beautiful ivory leg stubb it s an honor i consider it an honor listen wise stubb in old england the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen and made garter knights of but be _your_ boast stubb that ye were kicked by old ahab and made a wise man of remember what i say _be_ kicked by him account his kicks honors and on no account kick back for you can t help yourself wise stubb don t you see that pyramid with that he all of a sudden seemed somehow in some queer fashion to swim off into the air i snored rolled over and there i was in my hammock now what do you think of that dream flask  i don t know it seems a sort of foolish to me tho  may be may be but it s made a wise man of me flask d ye see ahab standing there sideways looking over the stern well the best thing you can do flask is to let the old man alone never speak to him whatever he says halloa what s that he shouts hark  mast head there look sharp all of ye there are whales hereabouts  if ye see a white one split your lungs for him  what do you think of that now flask ain t there a small drop of something queer about that eh a white whale did ye mark that man look ye there s something special in the wind stand by for it flask ahab has that that s bloody on his mind but mum he comes this way
