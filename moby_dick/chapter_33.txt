chapter 32 cetology  already we are boldly launched upon the deep but soon we shall be lost in its unshored harbourless immensities ere that come to pass ere the pequod s weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the leviathan at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to follow  it is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera that i would now fain put before you yet is it no easy task the classification of the constituents of a chaos nothing less is here essayed listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down  no branch of zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled cetology says captain scoresby a d 1820  it is not my intention were it in my power to enter into the inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal sperm whale says surgeon beale a d 1839  unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea a field strewn with thorns all these incomplete indications but serve to torture us naturalists  thus speak of the whale the great cuvier and john hunter and lesson those lights of zoology and anatomy nevertheless though of real knowledge there be little yet of books there are a plenty and so in some small degree with cetology or the science of whales many are the men small and great old and new landsmen and seamen who have at large or in little written of the whale run over a few the authors of the bible aristotle pliny aldrovandi sir thomas browne gesner ray linnæus rondeletius willoughby green artedi sibbald brisson marten lacépède bonneterre desmarest baron cuvier frederick cuvier john hunter owen scoresby beale bennett j ross browne the author of miriam coffin olmstead and the rev t cheever but to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written the above cited extracts will show  of the names in this list of whale authors only those following owen ever saw living whales and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer and whaleman i mean captain scoresby on the separate subject of the greenland or right whale he is the best existing authority but scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale compared with which the greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning and here be it said that the greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas he is not even by any means the largest of the whales yet owing to the long priority of his claims and the profound ignorance which till some seventy years back invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm whale and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whale ports this usurpation has been every way complete reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days will satisfy you that the greenland whale without one rival was to them the monarch of the seas but the time has at last come for a new proclamation this is charing cross hear ye good people all the greenland whale is deposed the great sperm whale now reigneth  there are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you and at the same time in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt those books are beale s and bennett s both in their time surgeons to english south sea whale ships and both exact and reliable men the original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small but so far as it goes it is of excellent quality though mostly confined to scientific description as yet however the sperm whale scientific or poetic lives not complete in any literature far above all other hunted whales his is an unwritten life  now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive classification if only an easy outline one for the present hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers as no better man advances to take this matter in hand i hereupon offer my own poor endeavors i promise nothing complete because any human thing supposed to be complete must for that very reason infallibly be faulty i shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species or in this place at least to much of any description my object here is simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology i am the architect not the builder  but it is a ponderous task no ordinary letter sorter in the post office is equal to it to grope down into the bottom of the sea after them to have one s hands among the unspeakable foundations ribs and very pelvis of the world this is a fearful thing what am i that i should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan the awful tauntings in job might well appal me will he the leviathan make a covenant with thee behold the hope of him is vain but i have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans i have had to do with whales with these visible hands i am in earnest and i will try there are some preliminaries to settle  first the uncertain unsettled condition of this science of cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact that in some quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish in his system of nature a d 1776 linnæus declares i hereby separate the whales from the fish but of my own knowledge i know that down to the year 1850 sharks and shad alewives and herring against linnæus s express edict were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the leviathan  the grounds upon which linnæus would fain have banished the whales from the waters he states as follows on account of their warm bilocular heart their lungs their movable eyelids their hollow ears penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem and finally ex lege naturæ jure meritoque i submitted all this to my friends simeon macey and charley coffin of nantucket both messmates of mine in a certain voyage and they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient charley profanely hinted they were humbug  be it known that waiving all argument i take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish and call upon holy jonah to back me this fundamental thing settled the next point is in what internal respect does the whale differ from other fish above linnæus has given you those items but in brief they are these lungs and warm blood whereas all other fish are lungless and cold blooded  next how shall we define the whale by his obvious externals so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come to be short then a whale is _a spouting fish with a horizontal tail_ there you have him however contracted that definition is the result of expanded meditation a walrus spouts much like a whale but the walrus is not a fish because he is amphibious but the last term of the definition is still more cogent as coupled with the first almost any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat but a vertical or up and down tail whereas among spouting fish the tail though it may be similarly shaped invariably assumes a horizontal position  by the above definition of what a whale is i do by no means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best informed nantucketers nor on the other hand link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien hence all the smaller spouting and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this ground plan of cetology now then come the grand divisions of the entire whale host  i am aware that down to the present time the fish styled lamatins and dugongs pig fish and sow fish of the coffins of nantucket are included by many naturalists among the whales but as these pig fish are a noisy contemptible set mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers and feeding on wet hay and especially as they do not spout i deny their credentials as whales and have presented them with their passports to quit the kingdom of cetology  first according to magnitude i divide the whales into three primary books subdivisible into chapters and these shall comprehend them all both small and large  i the folio whale ii the octavo whale iii the duodecimo whale  as the type of the folio i present the _sperm whale_ of the octavo the _grampus_ of the duodecimo the _porpoise_  folios among these i here include the following chapters i the _sperm whale_ ii the _right whale_ iii the _fin back whale_ iv the _hump backed whale_ v the _razor back whale_ vi the _sulphur bottom whale_  book i _folio_ chapter i _sperm whale_ this whale among the english of old vaguely known as the trumpa whale and the physeter whale and the anvil headed whale is the present cachalot of the french and the pottsfich of the germans and the macrocephalus of the long words he is without doubt the largest inhabitant of the globe the most formidable of all whales to encounter the most majestic in aspect and lastly by far the most valuable in commerce he being the only creature from which that valuable substance spermaceti is obtained all his peculiarities will in many other places be enlarged upon it is chiefly with his name that i now have to do philologically considered it is absurd some centuries ago when the sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish in those days spermaceti it would seem was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in england as the greenland or right whale it was the idea also that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the greenland whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses in those times also spermaceti was exceedingly scarce not being used for light but only as an ointment and medicament it was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb when as i opine in the course of time the true nature of spermaceti became known its original name was still retained by the dealers no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity and so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived  book i _folio_ chapter ii _right whale_ in one respect this is the most venerable of the leviathans being the one first regularly hunted by man it yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen and the oil specially known as whale oil an inferior article in commerce among the fishermen he is indiscriminately designated by all the following titles the whale the greenland whale the black whale the great whale the true whale the right whale there is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptised what then is the whale which i include in the second species of my folios it is the great mysticetus of the english naturalists the greenland whale of the english whalemen the baleine ordinaire of the french whalemen the growlands walfish of the swedes it is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the dutch and english in the arctic seas it is the whale which the american fishermen have long pursued in the indian ocean on the brazil banks on the nor west coast and various other parts of the world designated by them right whale cruising grounds  some pretend to see a difference between the greenland whale of the english and the right whale of the americans but they precisely agree in all their grand features nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction it is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences that some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate the right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length with reference to elucidating the sperm whale  book i _folio_ chapter iii _fin back_ under this head i reckon a monster which by the various names of fin back tall spout and long john has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the atlantic in the new york packet tracks in the length he attains and in his baleen the fin back resembles the right whale but is of a less portly girth and a lighter colour approaching to olive his great lips present a cable like aspect formed by the intertwisting slanting folds of large wrinkles his grand distinguishing feature the fin from which he derives his name is often a conspicuous object this fin is some three or four feet long growing vertically from the hinder part of the back of an angular shape and with a very sharp pointed end even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible this isolated fin will at times be seen plainly projecting from the surface when the sea is moderately calm and slightly marked with spherical ripples and this gnomon like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial with its style and wavy hour lines graved on it on that ahaz dial the shadow often goes back the fin back is not gregarious he seems a whale hater as some men are man haters very shy always going solitary unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming as to defy all present pursuit from man this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable cain of his race bearing for his mark that style upon his back from having the baleen in his mouth the fin back is sometimes included with the right whale among a theoretic species denominated _whalebone whales_ that is whales with baleen of these so called whalebone whales there would seem to be several varieties most of which however are little known broad nosed whales and beaked whales pike headed whales bunched whales under jawed whales and rostrated whales are the fishermen s names for a few sorts  in connection with this appellative of whalebone whales it is of great importance to mention that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the leviathan founded upon either his baleen or hump or fin or teeth notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions which the whale in his kinds presents how then the baleen hump back fin and teeth these are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars thus the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale each has a hump but there the similitude ceases then this same humpbacked whale and the greenland whale each of these has baleen but there again the similitude ceases and it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned in various sorts of whales they form such irregular combinations or in the case of any one of them detached such an irregular isolation as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis on this rock every one of the whale naturalists has split  but it may possibly be conceived that in the internal parts of the whale in his anatomy there at least we shall be able to hit the right classification nay what thing for example is there in the greenland whale s anatomy more striking than his baleen yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the greenland whale and if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated what then remains nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily in their entire liberal volume and boldly sort them that way and this is the bibliographical system here adopted and it is the only one that can possibly succeed for it alone is practicable to proceed  book i _folio_ chapter iv _hump back_ this whale is often seen on the northern american coast he has been frequently captured there and towed into harbor he has a great pack on him like a peddler or you might call him the elephant and castle whale at any rate the popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him since the sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one his oil is not very valuable he has baleen he is the most gamesome and light hearted of all the whales making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of them  book i _folio_ chapter v _razor back_ of this whale little is known but his name i have seen him at a distance off cape horn of a retiring nature he eludes both hunters and philosophers though no coward he has never yet shown any part of him but his back which rises in a long sharp ridge let him go i know little more of him nor does anybody else  book i _folio_ chapter vi _sulphur bottom_ another retiring gentleman with a brimstone belly doubtless got by scraping along the tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings he is seldom seen at least i have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance he is never chased he would run away with rope walks of line prodigies are told of him adieu sulphur bottom i can say nothing more that is true of ye nor can the oldest nantucketer  thus ends book i _folio_ and now begins book ii _octavo_  octavoes these embrace the whales of middling magnitude among which present may be numbered i the _grampus_ ii the _black fish_ iii the _narwhale_ iv the _thrasher_ v the _killer_  why this book of whales is not denominated the quarto is very plain because while the whales of this order though smaller than those of the former order nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure yet the bookbinder s quarto volume in its dimensioned form does not preserve the shape of the folio volume but the octavo volume does  book ii _octavo_ chapter i _grampus_ though this fish whose loud sonorous breathing or rather blowing has furnished a proverb to landsmen is so well known a denizen of the deep yet is he not popularly classed among whales but possessing all the grand distinctive features of the leviathan most naturalists have recognised him for one he is of moderate octavo size varying from fifteen to twenty five feet in length and of corresponding dimensions round the waist he swims in herds he is never regularly hunted though his oil is considerable in quantity and pretty good for light by some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale  book ii _octavo_ chapter ii _black fish_ i give the popular fishermen s names for all these fish for generally they are the best where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive i shall say so and suggest another i do so now touching the black fish so called because blackness is the rule among almost all whales so call him the hyena whale if you please his voracity is well known and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards he carries an everlasting mephistophelean grin on his face this whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length he is found in almost all latitudes he has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming which looks something like a roman nose when not more profitably employed the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the hyena whale to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment as some frugal housekeepers in the absence of company and quite alone by themselves burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax though their blubber is very thin some of these whales will yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil  book ii _octavo_ chapter iii _narwhale_ that is _nostril whale_ another instance of a curiously named whale so named i suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose the creature is some sixteen feet in length while its horn averages five feet though some exceed ten and even attain to fifteen feet strictly speaking this horn is but a lengthened tusk growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal but it is only found on the sinister side which has an ill effect giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left handed man what precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers it would be hard to say it does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword fish and bill fish though some sailors tell me that the narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food charley coffin said it was used for an ice piercer for the narwhale rising to the surface of the polar sea and finding it sheeted with ice thrusts his horn up and so breaks through but you cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct my own opinion is that however this one sided horn may really be used by the narwhale however that may be it would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets the narwhale i have heard called the tusked whale the horned whale and the unicorn whale he is certainly a curious example of the unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature from certain cloistered old authors i have gathered that this same sea unicorn s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison and as such preparations of it brought immense prices it was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies the same way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity black letter tells me that sir martin frobisher on his return from that voyage when queen bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of greenwich palace as his bold ship sailed down the thames when sir martin returned from that voyage saith black letter on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the narwhale which for a long period after hung in the castle at windsor an irish author avers that the earl of leicester on bended knees did likewise present to her highness another horn pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature  the narwhale has a very picturesque leopard like look being of a milk white ground colour dotted with round and oblong spots of black his oil is very superior clear and fine but there is little of it and he is seldom hunted he is mostly found in the circumpolar seas  book ii _octavo_ chapter iv _killer_ of this whale little is precisely known to the nantucketer and nothing at all to the professed naturalist from what i have seen of him at a distance i should say that he was about the bigness of a grampus he is very savage a sort of feegee fish he sometimes takes the great folio whales by the lip and hangs there like a leech till the mighty brute is worried to death the killer is never hunted i never heard what sort of oil he has exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale on the ground of its indistinctness for we are all killers on land and on sea bonapartes and sharks included  book ii _octavo_ chapter v _thrasher_ this gentleman is famous for his tail which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes he mounts the folio whale s back and as he swims he works his passage by flogging him as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process still less is known of the thrasher than of the killer both are outlaws even in the lawless seas  thus ends book ii _octavo_ and begins book iii _duodecimo_  duodecimoes these include the smaller whales i the huzza porpoise ii the algerine porpoise iii the mealy mouthed porpoise  to those who have not chanced specially to study the subject it may possibly seem strange that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be marshalled among whales a word which in the popular sense always conveys an idea of hugeness but the creatures set down above as duodecimoes are infallibly whales by the terms of my definition of what a whale is _i e _ a spouting fish with a horizontal tail  book iii _duodecimo_ chapter 1 _huzza porpoise_ this is the common porpoise found almost all over the globe the name is of my own bestowal for there are more than one sort of porpoises and something must be done to distinguish them i call him thus because he always swims in hilarious shoals which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a fourth of july crowd their appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner full of fine spirits they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward they are the lads that always live before the wind they are accounted a lucky omen if you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish then heaven help ye the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye a well fed plump huzza porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil but the fine and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable it is in request among jewellers and watchmakers sailors put it on their hones porpoise meat is good eating you know it may never have occurred to you that a porpoise spouts indeed his spout is so small that it is not very readily discernible but the next time you have a chance watch him and you will then see the great sperm whale himself in miniature  book iii _duodecimo_ chapter ii _algerine porpoise_ a pirate very savage he is only found i think in the pacific he is somewhat larger than the huzza porpoise but much of the same general make provoke him and he will buckle to a shark i have lowered for him many times but never yet saw him captured  book iii _duodecimo_ chapter iii _mealy mouthed porpoise_ the largest kind of porpoise and only found in the pacific so far as it is known the only english name by which he has hitherto been designated is that of the fishers right whale porpoise from the circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that folio in shape he differs in some degree from the huzza porpoise being of a less rotund and jolly girth indeed he is of quite a neat and gentleman like figure he has no fins on his back most other porpoises have he has a lovely tail and sentimental indian eyes of a hazel hue but his mealy mouth spoils all though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable yet a boundary line distinct as the mark in a ship s hull called the bright waist that line streaks him from stem to stern with two separate colours black above and white below the white comprises part of his head and the whole of his mouth which makes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a meal bag a most mean and mealy aspect his oil is much like that of the common porpoise    beyond the duodecimo this system does not proceed inasmuch as the porpoise is the smallest of the whales above you have all the leviathans of note but there are a rabble of uncertain fugitive half fabulous whales which as an american whaleman i know by reputation but not personally i shall enumerate them by their fore castle appellations for possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators who may complete what i have here but begun if any of the following whales shall hereafter be caught and marked then he can readily be incorporated into this system according to his folio octavo or duodecimo magnitude the bottle nose whale the junk whale the pudding headed whale the cape whale the leading whale the cannon whale the scragg whale the coppered whale the elephant whale the iceberg whale the quog whale the blue whale etc from icelandic dutch and old english authorities there might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales blessed with all manner of uncouth names but i omit them as altogether obsolete and can hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds full of leviathanism but signifying nothing  finally it was stated at the outset that this system would not be here and at once perfected you cannot but plainly see that i have kept my word but i now leave my cetological system standing thus unfinished even as the great cathedral of cologne was left with the crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower for small erections may be finished by their first architects grand ones true ones ever leave the copestone to posterity god keep me from ever completing anything this whole book is but a draught nay but the draught of a draught oh time strength cash and patience
