chapter 34 the cabin table  it is noon and dough boy the steward thrusting his pale loaf of bread face from the cabin scuttle announces dinner to his lord and master who sitting in the lee quarter boat has just been taking an observation of the sun and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth medallion shaped tablet reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg from his complete inattention to the tidings you would think that moody ahab had not heard his menial but presently catching hold of the mizen shrouds he swings himself to the deck and in an even unexhilarated voice saying dinner mr starbuck disappears into the cabin  when the last echo of his sultan s step has died away and starbuck the first emir has every reason to suppose that he is seated then starbuck rouses from his quietude takes a few turns along the planks and after a grave peep into the binnacle says with some touch of pleasantness dinner mr stubb and descends the scuttle the second emir lounges about the rigging awhile and then slightly shaking the main brace to see whether it will be all right with that important rope he likewise takes up the old burden and with a rapid dinner mr flask follows after his predecessors  but the third emir now seeing himself all alone on the quarter deck seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint for tipping all sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions and kicking off his shoes he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the grand turk s head and then by a dexterous sleight pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf he goes down rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck reversing all other processions by bringing up the rear with music but ere stepping into the cabin doorway below he pauses ships a new face altogether and then independent hilarious little flask enters king ahab s presence in the character of abjectus or the slave  it is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense artificialness of sea usages that while in the open air of the deck some officers will upon provocation bear themselves boldly and defyingly enough towards their commander yet ten to one let those very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commander s cabin and straightway their inoffensive not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him as he sits at the head of the table this is marvellous sometimes most comical wherefore this difference a problem perhaps not to have been belshazzar king of babylon and to have been belshazzar not haughtily but courteously therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur but he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own private dinner table of invited guests that man s unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the time that man s royalty of state transcends belshazzar s for belshazzar was not the greatest who has but once dined his friends has tasted what it is to be c√¶sar it is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding now if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a ship master then by inference you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of sea life just mentioned  over his ivory inlaid table ahab presided like a mute maned sea lion on the white coral beach surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs in his own proper turn each officer waited to be served they were as little children before ahab and yet in ahab there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance with one mind their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man s knife as he carved the chief dish before him i do not suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation even upon so neutral a topic as the weather no and when reaching out his knife and fork between which the slice of beef was locked ahab thereby motioned starbuck s plate towards him the mate received his meat as though receiving alms and cut it tenderly and a little started if perchance the knife grazed against the plate and chewed it noiselessly and swallowed it not without circumspection for like the coronation banquet at frankfort where the german emperor profoundly dines with the seven imperial electors so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals eaten in awful silence and yet at table old ahab forbade not conversation only he himself was dumb what a relief it was to choking stubb when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below and poor little flask he was the youngest son and little boy of this weary family party his were the shinbones of the saline beef his would have been the drumsticks for flask to have presumed to help himself this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree had he helped himself at that table doubtless never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world nevertheless strange to say ahab never forbade him and had flask helped himself the chances were ahab had never so much as noticed it least of all did flask presume to help himself to butter whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him on account of its clotting his clear sunny complexion or whether he deemed that on so long a voyage in such marketless waters butter was at a premium and therefore was not for him a subaltern however it was flask alas was a butterless man  another thing flask was the last person down at the dinner and flask is the first man up consider for hereby flask s dinner was badly jammed in point of time starbuck and stubb both had the start of him and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear if stubb even who is but a peg higher than flask happens to have but a small appetite and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast then flask must bestir himself he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day for it is against holy usage for stubb to precede flask to the deck therefore it was that flask once admitted in private that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer from that moment he had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry more or less for what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger as keep it immortal in him peace and satisfaction thought flask have for ever departed from my stomach i am an officer but how i wish i could fish a bit of old fashioned beef in the forecastle as i used to when i was before the mast there s the fruits of promotion now there s the vanity of glory there s the insanity of life besides if it were so that any mere sailor of the pequod had a grudge against flask in flask s official capacity all that sailor had to do in order to obtain ample vengeance was to go aft at dinner time and get a peep at flask through the cabin sky light sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful ahab  now ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in the pequod s cabin after their departure taking place in inverted order to their arrival the canvas cloth was cleared or rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward and then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast they being its residuary legatees they made a sort of temporary servants hall of the high and mighty cabin  in strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible domineerings of the captain s table was the entire care free license and ease the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows the harpooneers while their masters the mates seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws the harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a report to it they dined like lords they filled their bellies like indian ships all day loading with spices such portentous appetites had queequeg and tashtego that to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast often the pale dough boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt junk seemingly quarried out of the solid ox and if he were not lively about it if he did not go with a nimble hop skip and jump then tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back harpoon wise and once daggoo seized with a sudden humor assisted dough boy s memory by snatching him up bodily and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher while tashtego knife in hand began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him he was naturally a very nervous shuddering sort of little fellow this bread faced steward the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse and what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific ahab and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages dough boy s whole life was one continual lip quiver commonly after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door till all was over  it was a sight to see queequeg seated over against tashtego opposing his filed teeth to the indian s crosswise to them daggoo seated on the floor for a bench would have brought his hearse plumed head to the low carlines at every motion of his colossal limbs making the low cabin framework to shake as when an african elephant goes passenger in a ship but for all this the great negro was wonderfully abstemious not to say dainty it seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad baronial and superb a person but doubtless this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds not by beef or by bread are giants made or nourished but queequeg he had a mortal barbaric smack of the lip in eating an ugly sound enough so much so that the trembling dough boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms and when he would hear tashtego singing out for him to produce himself that his bones might be picked the simple witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round him in the pantry by his sudden fits of the palsy nor did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets for their lances and other weapons and with which whetstones at dinner they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives that grating sound did not at all tend to tranquillize poor dough boy how could he forget that in his island days queequeg for one must certainly have been guilty of some murderous convivial indiscretions alas dough boy hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals not a napkin should he carry on his arm but a buckler in good time though to his great delight the three salt sea warriors would rise and depart to his credulous fable mongering ears all their martial bones jingling in them at every step like moorish scimetars in scabbards  but though these barbarians dined in the cabin and nominally lived there still being anything but sedentary in their habits they were scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes and just before sleeping time when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters  in this one matter ahab seemed no exception to most american whale captains who as a set rather incline to the opinion that by rights the ship s cabin belongs to them and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is at any time permitted there so that in real truth the mates and harpooneers of the pequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it for when they did enter it it was something as a street door enters a house turning inwards for a moment only to be turned out the next and as a permanent thing residing in the open air nor did they lose much hereby in the cabin was no companionship socially ahab was inaccessible though nominally included in the census of christendom he was still an alien to it he lived in the world as the last of the grisly bears lived in settled missouri and as when spring and summer had departed that wild logan of the woods burying himself in the hollow of a tree lived out the winter there sucking his own paws so in his inclement howling old age ahab s soul shut up in the caved trunk of his body there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom
