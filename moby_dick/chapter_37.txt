chapter 36 the quarter deck  _enter ahab then all _  it was not a great while after the affair of the pipe that one morning shortly after breakfast ahab as was his wont ascended the cabin gangway to the deck there most sea captains usually walk at that hour as country gentlemen after the same meal take a few turns in the garden  soon his steady ivory stride was heard as to and fro he paced his old rounds upon planks so familiar to his tread that they were all over dented like geological stones with the peculiar mark of his walk did you fixedly gaze too upon that ribbed and dented brow there also you would see still stranger foot prints the foot prints of his one unsleeping ever pacing thought  but on the occasion in question those dents looked deeper even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark and so full of his thought was ahab that at every uniform turn that he made now at the main mast and now at the binnacle you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned and pace in him as he paced so completely possessing him indeed that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement  d ye mark him flask whispered stubb the chick that s in him pecks the shell twill soon be out  the hours wore on ahab now shut up within his cabin anon pacing the deck with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect  it drew near the close of day suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks and inserting his bone leg into the auger hole there and with one hand grasping a shroud he ordered starbuck to send everybody aft  sir said the mate astonished at an order seldom or never given on ship board except in some extraordinary case  send everybody aft repeated ahab mast heads there come down  when the entire ship s company were assembled and with curious and not wholly unapprehensive faces were eyeing him for he looked not unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up ahab after rapidly glancing over the bulwarks and then darting his eyes among the crew started from his standpoint and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck with bent head and half slouched hat he continued to pace unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men till stubb cautiously whispered to flask that ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat but this did not last long vehemently pausing he cried  what do ye do when ye see a whale men  sing out for him was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed voices  good cried ahab with a wild approval in his tones observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically thrown them  and what do ye next men  lower away and after him  and what tune is it ye pull to men  a dead whale or a stove boat  more and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving grew the countenance of the old man at every shout while the mariners began to gaze curiously at each other as if marvelling how it was that they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions  but they were all eagerness again as ahab now half revolving in his pivot hole with one hand reaching high up a shroud and tightly almost convulsively grasping it addressed them thus  all ye mast headers have before now heard me give orders about a white whale look ye d ye see this spanish ounce of gold holding up a broad bright coin to the sun it is a sixteen dollar piece men d ye see it mr starbuck hand me yon top maul  while the mate was getting the hammer ahab without speaking was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket as if to heighten its lustre and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him  receiving the top maul from starbuck he advanced towards the main mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand exhibiting the gold with the other and with a high raised voice exclaiming whosoever of ye raises me a white headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw whosoever of ye raises me that white headed whale with three holes punctured in his starboard fluke look ye whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale he shall have this gold ounce my boys  huzza huzza cried the seamen as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast  it s a white whale i say resumed ahab as he threw down the topmaul a white whale skin your eyes for him men look sharp for white water if ye see but a bubble sing out  all this while tashtego daggoo and queequeg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately touched by some specific recollection  captain ahab said tashtego that white whale must be the same that some call moby dick  moby dick shouted ahab do ye know the white whale then tash  does he fan tail a little curious sir before he goes down said the gay header deliberately  and has he a curious spout too said daggoo very bushy even for a parmacetty and mighty quick captain ahab  and he have one two three oh good many iron in him hide too captain cried queequeg disjointedly all twiske tee be twisk like him him faltering hard for a word and screwing his hand round and round as though uncorking a bottle like him him  corkscrew cried ahab aye queequeg the harpoons lie all twisted and wrenched in him aye daggoo his spout is a big one like a whole shock of wheat and white as a pile of our nantucket wool after the great annual sheep shearing aye tashtego and he fan tails like a split jib in a squall death and devils men it is moby dick ye have seen moby dick moby dick  captain ahab said starbuck who with stubb and flask had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder captain ahab i have heard of moby dick but it was not moby dick that took off thy leg  who told thee that cried ahab then pausing aye starbuck aye my hearties all round it was moby dick that dismasted me moby dick that brought me to this dead stump i stand on now aye aye he shouted with a terrific loud animal sob like that of a heart stricken moose aye aye it was that accursed white whale that razed me made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day then tossing both arms with measureless imprecations he shouted out aye aye and i ll chase him round good hope and round the horn and round the norway maelstrom and round perdition s flames before i give him up and this is what ye have shipped for men to chase that white whale on both sides of land and over all sides of earth till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out what say ye men will ye splice hands on it now i think ye do look brave  aye aye shouted the harpooneers and seamen running closer to the excited old man a sharp eye for the white whale a sharp lance for moby dick  god bless ye he seemed to half sob and half shout god bless ye men steward go draw the great measure of grog but what s this long face about mr starbuck wilt thou not chase the white whale art not game for moby dick  i am game for his crooked jaw and for the jaws of death too captain ahab if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow but i came here to hunt whales not my commander s vengeance how many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it captain ahab it will not fetch thee much in our nantucket market  nantucket market hoot but come closer starbuck thou requirest a little lower layer if money s to be the measurer man and the accountants have computed their great counting house the globe by girdling it with guineas one to every three parts of an inch then let me tell thee that my vengeance will fetch a great premium _here _  he smites his chest whispered stubb what s that for methinks it rings most vast but hollow  vengeance on a dumb brute cried starbuck that simply smote thee from blindest instinct madness to be enraged with a dumb thing captain ahab seems blasphemous  hark ye yet again the little lower layer all visible objects man are but as pasteboard masks but in each event in the living act the undoubted deed there some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask if man will strike strike through the mask how can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall to me the white whale is that wall shoved near to me sometimes i think there s naught beyond but tis enough he tasks me he heaps me i see in him outrageous strength with an inscrutable malice sinewing it that inscrutable thing is chiefly what i hate and be the white whale agent or be the white whale principal i will wreak that hate upon him talk not to me of blasphemy man i d strike the sun if it insulted me for could the sun do that then could i do the other since there is ever a sort of fair play herein jealousy presiding over all creations but not my master man is even that fair play who s over me truth hath no confines take off thine eye more intolerable than fiends glarings is a doltish stare so so thou reddenest and palest my heat has melted thee to anger glow but look ye starbuck what is said in heat that thing unsays itself there are men from whom warm words are small indignity i meant not to incense thee let it go look see yonder turkish cheeks of spotted tawn living breathing pictures painted by the sun the pagan leopards the unrecking and unworshipping things that live and seek and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel the crew man the crew are they not one and all with ahab in this matter of the whale see stubb he laughs see yonder chilian he snorts to think of it stand up amid the general hurricane thy one tost sapling cannot starbuck and what is it reckon it tis but to help strike a fin no wondrous feat for starbuck what is it more from this one poor hunt then the best lance out of all nantucket surely he will not hang back when every foremast hand has clutched a whetstone ah constrainings seize thee i see the billow lifts thee speak but speak aye aye thy silence then _that_ voices thee _aside_ something shot from my dilated nostrils he has inhaled it in his lungs starbuck now is mine cannot oppose me now without rebellion  god keep me keep us all murmured starbuck lowly  but in his joy at the enchanted tacit acquiescence of the mate ahab did not hear his foreboding invocation nor yet the low laugh from the hold nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts as for a moment their hearts sank in for again starbuck s downcast eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life the subterranean laugh died away the winds blew on the sails filled out the ship heaved and rolled as before ah ye admonitions and warnings why stay ye not when ye come but rather are ye predictions than warnings ye shadows yet not so much predictions from without as verifications of the foregoing things within for with little external to constrain us the innermost necessities in our being these still drive us on  the measure the measure cried ahab  receiving the brimming pewter and turning to the harpooneers he ordered them to produce their weapons then ranging them before him near the capstan with their harpoons in their hands while his three mates stood at his side with their lances and the rest of the ship s company formed a circle round the group he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every man of his crew but those wild eyes met his as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison but alas only to fall into the hidden snare of the indian  drink and pass he cried handing the heavy charged flagon to the nearest seaman the crew alone now drink round with it round short draughts long swallows men tis hot as satan s hoof so so it goes round excellently it spiralizes in ye forks out at the serpent snapping eye well done almost drained that way it went this way it comes hand it me here s a hollow men ye seem the years so brimming life is gulped and gone steward refill  attend now my braves i have mustered ye all round this capstan and ye mates flank me with your lances and ye harpooneers stand there with your irons and ye stout mariners ring me in that i may in some sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me o men you will yet see that ha boy come back bad pennies come not sooner hand it me why now this pewter had run brimming again wer t not thou st vitus imp away thou ague  advance ye mates cross your lances full before me well done let me touch the axis so saying with extended arm he grasped the three level radiating lances at their crossed centre while so doing suddenly and nervously twitched them meanwhile glancing intently from starbuck to stubb from stubb to flask it seemed as though by some nameless interior volition he would fain have shocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the leyden jar of his own magnetic life the three mates quailed before his strong sustained and mystic aspect stubb and flask looked sideways from him the honest eye of starbuck fell downright  in vain cried ahab but maybe tis well for did ye three but once take the full forced shock then mine own electric thing _that_ had perhaps expired from out me perchance too it would have dropped ye dead perchance ye need it not down lances and now ye mates i do appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there yon three most honorable gentlemen and noblemen my valiant harpooneers disdain the task what when the great pope washes the feet of beggars using his tiara for ewer oh my sweet cardinals your own condescension _that_ shall bend ye to it i do not order ye ye will it cut your seizings and draw the poles ye harpooneers  silently obeying the order the three harpooneers now stood with the detached iron part of their harpoons some three feet long held barbs up before him  stab me not with that keen steel cant them cant them over know ye not the goblet end turn up the socket so so now ye cup bearers advance the irons take them hold them while i fill forthwith slowly going from one officer to the other he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter  now three to three ye stand commend the murderous chalices bestow them ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league ha starbuck but the deed is done yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon it drink ye harpooneers drink and swear ye men that man the deathful whaleboat s bow death to moby dick god hunt us all if we do not hunt moby dick to his death the long barbed steel goblets were lifted and to cries and maledictions against the white whale the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss starbuck paled and turned and shivered once more and finally the replenished pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew when waving his free hand to them they all dispersed and ahab retired within his cabin
