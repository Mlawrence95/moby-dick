chapter 38 dusk  _by the mainmast starbuck leaning against it_  my soul is more than matched she s overmanned and by a madman insufferable sting that sanity should ground arms on such a field but he drilled deep down and blasted all my reason out of me i think i see his impious end but feel that i must help him to it will i nill i the ineffable thing has tied me to him tows me with a cable i have no knife to cut horrible old man who s over him he cries aye he would be a democrat to all above look how he lords it over all below oh i plainly see my miserable office to obey rebelling and worse yet to hate with touch of pity for in his eyes i read some lurid woe would shrivel me up had i it yet is there hope time and tide flow wide the hated whale has the round watery world to swim in as the small gold fish has its glassy globe his heaven insulting purpose god may wedge aside i would up heart were it not like lead but my whole clock s run down my heart the all controlling weight i have no key to lift again  _a burst of revelry from the forecastle_  oh god to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of human mothers in them whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea the white whale is their demigorgon hark the infernal orgies that revelry is forward mark the unfaltering silence aft methinks it pictures life foremost through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay embattled bantering bow but only to drag dark ahab after it where he broods within his sternward cabin builded over the dead water of the wake and further on hunted by its wolfish gurglings the long howl thrills me through peace ye revellers and set the watch oh life tis in an hour like this with soul beat down and held to knowledge as wild untutored things are forced to feed oh life tis now that i do feel the latent horror in thee but tis not me that horror s out of me and with the soft feeling of the human in me yet will i try to fight ye ye grim phantom futures stand by me hold me bind me o ye blessed influences
