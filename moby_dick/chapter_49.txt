chapter 48 the first lowering  the phantoms for so they then seemed were flitting on the other side of the deck and with a noiseless celerity were casting loose the tackles and bands of the boat which swung there this boat had always been deemed one of the spare boats though technically called the captain s on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter the figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart with one white tooth evilly protruding from its steel like lips a rumpled chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff but strangely crowning this ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head less swart in aspect the companions of this figure were of that vivid tiger yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the manillas a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty and by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the water of the devil their lord whose counting room they suppose to be elsewhere  while yet the wondering ship s company were gazing upon these strangers ahab cried out to the white turbaned old man at their head all ready there fedallah  ready was the half hissed reply  lower away then d ye hear shouting across the deck lower away there i say  such was the thunder of his voice that spite of their amazement the men sprang over the rail the sheaves whirled round in the blocks with a wallow the three boats dropped into the sea while with a dexterous off handed daring unknown in any other vocation the sailors goat like leaped down the rolling ship s side into the tossed boats below  hardly had they pulled out from under the ship s lee when a fourth keel coming from the windward side pulled round under the stern and showed the five strangers rowing ahab who standing erect in the stern loudly hailed starbuck stubb and flask to spread themselves widely so as to cover a large expanse of water but with all their eyes again riveted upon the swart fedallah and his crew the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command  captain ahab said starbuck  spread yourselves cried ahab give way all four boats thou flask pull out more to leeward  aye aye sir cheerily cried little king post sweeping round his great steering oar lay back addressing his crew there there there again there she blows right ahead boys lay back  never heed yonder yellow boys archy  oh i don t mind em sir said archy i knew it all before now didn t i hear em in the hold and didn t i tell cabaco here of it what say ye cabaco they are stowaways mr flask  pull pull my fine hearts alive pull my children pull my little ones drawlingly and soothingly sighed stubb to his crew some of whom still showed signs of uneasiness why don t you break your backbones my boys what is it you stare at those chaps in yonder boat tut they are only five more hands come to help us never mind from where the more the merrier pull then do pull never mind the brimstone devils are good fellows enough so so there you are now that s the stroke for a thousand pounds that s the stroke to sweep the stakes hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil my heroes three cheers men all hearts alive easy easy don t be in a hurry don t be in a hurry why don t you snap your oars you rascals bite something you dogs so so so then softly softly that s it that s it long and strong give way there give way the devil fetch ye ye ragamuffin rapscallions ye are all asleep stop snoring ye sleepers and pull pull will ye pull can t ye pull won t ye why in the name of gudgeons and ginger cakes don t ye pull pull and break something pull and start your eyes out here whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle every mother s son of ye draw his knife and pull with the blade between his teeth that s it that s it now ye do something that looks like it my steel bits start her start her my silver spoons start her marling spikes  stubb s exordium to his crew is given here at large because he had rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general and especially in inculcating the religion of rowing but you must not suppose from this specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions with his congregation not at all and therein consisted his chief peculiarity he would say the most terrific things to his crew in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury and the fury seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun that no oarsman could hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing besides he all the time looked so easy and indolent himself so loungingly managed his steering oar and so broadly gaped open mouthed at times that the mere sight of such a yawning commander by sheer force of contrast acted like a charm upon the crew then again stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them  in obedience to a sign from ahab starbuck was now pulling obliquely across stubb s bow and when for a minute or so the two boats were pretty near to each other stubb hailed the mate  mr starbuck larboard boat there ahoy a word with ye sir if ye please  halloa returned starbuck turning round not a single inch as he spoke still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew his face set like a flint from stubb s  what think ye of those yellow boys sir  smuggled on board somehow before the ship sailed strong strong boys in a whisper to his crew then speaking out loud again a sad business mr stubb seethe her seethe her my lads but never mind mr stubb all for the best let all your crew pull strong come what will spring my men spring there s hogsheads of sperm ahead mr stubb and that s what ye came for pull my boys sperm sperm s the play this at least is duty duty and profit hand in hand  aye aye i thought as much soliloquized stubb when the boats diverged as soon as i clapt eye on em i thought so aye and that s what he went into the after hold for so often as dough boy long suspected they were hidden down there the white whale s at the bottom of it well well so be it can t be helped all right give way men it ain t the white whale to day give way  now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as the lowering of the boats from the deck this had not unreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship s company but archy s fancied discovery having some time previous got abroad among them though indeed not credited then this had in some small measure prepared them for the event it took off the extreme edge of their wonder and so what with all this and stubb s confident way of accounting for their appearance they were for the time freed from superstitious surmisings though the affair still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures as to dark ahab s precise agency in the matter from the beginning for me i silently recalled the mysterious shadows i had seen creeping on board the pequod during the dim nantucket dawn as well as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable elijah  meantime ahab out of hearing of his officers having sided the furthest to windward was still ranging ahead of the other boats a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone like five trip hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength which periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a mississippi steamer as for fedallah who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar he had thrown aside his black jacket and displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery horizon while at the other end of the boat ahab with one arm like a fencer s thrown half backward into the air as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the white whale had torn him all at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed while the boat s five oars were seen simultaneously peaked boat and crew sat motionless on the sea instantly the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way the whales had irregularly settled bodily down into the blue thus giving no distantly discernible token of the movement though from his closer vicinity ahab had observed it  every man look out along his oars cried starbuck thou queequeg stand up  nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow the savage stood erect there and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the spot where the chase had last been descried likewise upon the extreme stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with the gunwale starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea  not very far distant flask s boat was also lying breathlessly still its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead a stout sort of post rooted in the keel and rising some two feet above the level of the stern platform it is used for catching turns with the whale line its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man s hand and standing upon such a base as that flask seemed perched at the mast head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks but little king post was small and short and at the same time little king post was full of a large and tall ambition so that this loggerhead stand point of his did by no means satisfy king post  i can t see three seas off tip us up an oar there and let me on to that  upon this daggoo with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way swiftly slid aft and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty shoulders for a pedestal  good a mast head as any sir will you mount  that i will and thank ye very much my fine fellow only i wish you fifty feet taller  whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the boat the gigantic negro stooping a little presented his flat palm to flask s foot and then putting flask s hand on his hearse plumed head and bidding him spring as he himself should toss with one dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders and here was flask now standing daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself by  at any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and cross running seas still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself under such circumstances but the sight of little flask mounted upon gigantic daggoo was yet more curious for sustaining himself with a cool indifferent easy unthought of barbaric majesty the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form on his broad back flaxen haired flask seemed a snow flake the bearer looked nobler than the rider though truly vivacious tumultuous ostentatious little flask would now and then stamp with impatience but not one added heave did he thereby give to the negro s lordly chest so have i seen passion and vanity stamping the living magnanimous earth but the earth did not alter her tides and her seasons for that  meanwhile stubb the third mate betrayed no such far gazing solicitudes the whales might have made one of their regular soundings not a temporary dive from mere fright and if that were the case stubb as his wont in such cases it seems was resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe he withdrew it from his hatband where he always wore it aslant like a feather he loaded it and rammed home the loading with his thumb end but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand when tashtego his harpooneer whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry down down all and give way there they are  to a landsman no whale nor any sign of a herring would have been visible at that moment nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white water and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it and suffusingly blowing off to leeward like the confused scud from white rolling billows the air around suddenly vibrated and tingled as it were like the air over intensely heated plates of iron beneath this atmospheric waving and curling and partially beneath a thin layer of water also the whales were swimming seen in advance of all the other indications the puffs of vapor they spouted seemed their forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders  all four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water and air but it bade fair to outstrip them it flew on and on as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills  pull pull my good boys said starbuck in the lowest possible but intensest concentrated whisper to his men while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow almost seemed as two visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses he did not say much to his crew though nor did his crew say anything to him only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers now harsh with command now soft with entreaty  how different the loud little king post sing out and say something my hearties roar and pull my thunderbolts beach me beach me on their black backs boys only do that for me and i ll sign over to you my martha s vineyard plantation boys including wife and children boys lay me on lay me on o lord lord but i shall go stark staring mad see see that white water and so shouting he pulled his hat from his head and stamped up and down on it then picking it up flirted it far off upon the sea and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat s stern like a crazed colt from the prairie  look at that chap now philosophically drawled stubb who with his unlighted short pipe mechanically retained between his teeth at a short distance followed after he s got fits that flask has fits yes give him fits that s the very word pitch fits into em merrily merrily hearts alive pudding for supper you know merry s the word pull babes pull sucklings pull all but what the devil are you hurrying about softly softly and steadily my men only pull and keep pulling nothing more crack all your backbones and bite your knives in two that s all take it easy why don t ye take it easy i say and burst all your livers and lungs  but what it was that inscrutable ahab said to that tiger yellow crew of his these were words best omitted here for you live under the blessed light of the evangelical land only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas may give ear to such words when with tornado brow and eyes of red murder and foam glued lips ahab leaped after his prey  meanwhile all the boats tore on the repeated specific allusions of flask to that whale as he called the fictitious monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat s bow with its tail these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life like that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the shoulder but this was against all rule for the oarsmen must put out their eyes and ram a skewer through their necks usage pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears and no limbs but arms in these critical moments  it was a sight full of quick wonder and awe the vast swells of the omnipotent sea the surging hollow roar they made as they rolled along the eight gunwales like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling green the brief suspended agony of the boat as it would tip for an instant on the knife like edge of the sharper waves that almost seemed threatening to cut it in two the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and hollows the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite hill the headlong sled like slide down its other side all these with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers and the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen with the wondrous sight of the ivory pequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails like a wild hen after her screaming brood all this was thrilling  not the raw recruit marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever heat of his first battle not the dead man s ghost encountering the first unknown phantom in the other world neither of these can feel stranger and stronger emotions than that man does who for the first time finds himself pulling into the charmed churned circle of the hunted sperm whale  the dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more visible owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud shadows flung upon the sea the jets of vapor no longer blended but tilted everywhere to right and left the whales seemed separating their wakes the boats were pulled more apart starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward our sail was now set and with the still rising wind we rushed along the boat going with such madness through the water that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the row locks  soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist neither ship nor boat to be seen  give way men whispered starbuck drawing still further aft the sheet of his sail there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes there s white water again close to spring  soon after two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted that the other boats had got fast but hardly were they overheard when with a lightning like hurtling whisper starbuck said stand up and queequeg harpoon in hand sprang to his feet  though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril so close to them ahead yet with their eyes on the intense countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat they knew that the imminent instant had come they heard too an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter meanwhile the boat was still booming through the mist the waves curling and hissing around us like the erected crests of enraged serpents  that s his hump _there_ _there_ give it to him whispered starbuck  a short rushing sound leaped out of the boat it was the darted iron of queequeg then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from astern while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge the sail collapsed and exploded a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us the whole crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter skelter into the white curdling cream of the squall squall whale and harpoon had all blended together and the whale merely grazed by the iron escaped  though completely swamped the boat was nearly unharmed swimming round it we picked up the floating oars and lashing them across the gunwale tumbled back to our places there we sat up to our knees in the sea the water covering every rib and plank so that to our downward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of the ocean  the wind increased to a howl the waves dashed their bucklers together the whole squall roared forked and crackled around us like a white fire upon the prairie in which unconsumed we were burning immortal in these jaws of death in vain we hailed the other boats as well roar to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm meanwhile the driving scud rack and mist grew darker with the shadows of night no sign of the ship could be seen the rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat the oars were useless as propellers performing now the office of life preservers so cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg after many failures starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern then stretching it on a waif pole handed it to queequeg as the standard bearer of this forlorn hope there then he sat holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness there then he sat the sign and symbol of a man without faith hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair  wet drenched through and shivering cold despairing of ship or boat we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on the mist still spread over the sea the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat suddenly queequeg started to his feet hollowing his hand to his ear we all heard a faint creaking as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm the sound came nearer and nearer the thick mists were dimly parted by a huge vague form affrighted we all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view bearing right down upon us within a distance of not much more than its length  floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat as for one instant it tossed and gaped beneath the ship s bows like a chip at the base of a cataract and then the vast hull rolled over it and it was seen no more till it came up weltering astern again we swam for it were dashed against it by the seas and were at last taken up and safely landed on board ere the squall came close to the other boats had cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time the ship had given us up but was still cruising if haply it might light upon some token of our perishing an oar or a lance pole
