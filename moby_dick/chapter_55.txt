chapter 54 the town ho s story  _as told at the golden inn _  the cape of good hope and all the watery region round about there is much like some noted four corners of a great highway where you meet more travellers than in any other part  it was not very long after speaking the goney that another homeward bound whaleman the town ho was encountered she was manned almost wholly by polynesians in the short gam that ensued she gave us strong news of moby dick to some the general interest in the white whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the town ho s story which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of god which at times are said to overtake some men this latter circumstance with its own particular accompaniments forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated never reached the ears of captain ahab or his mates for that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the town ho himself it was the private property of three confederate white seamen of that ship one of whom it seems communicated it to tashtego with romish injunctions of secrecy but the following night tashtego rambled in his sleep and revealed so much of it in that way that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest nevertheless so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen in the pequod who came to the full knowledge of it and by such a strange delicacy to call it so were they governed in this matter that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never transpired abaft the pequod s main mast interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship the whole of this strange affair i now proceed to put on lasting record  the ancient whale cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast head still used by whalemen in hunting the famous gallipagos terrapin  for my humor s sake i shall preserve the style in which i once narrated it at lima to a lounging circle of my spanish friends one saint s eve smoking upon the thick gilt tiled piazza of the golden inn of those fine cavaliers the young dons pedro and sebastian were on the closer terms with me and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put and which are duly answered at the time  some two years prior to my first learning the events which i am about rehearsing to you gentlemen the town ho sperm whaler of nantucket was cruising in your pacific here not very many days sail eastward from the eaves of this good golden inn she was somewhere to the northward of the line one morning upon handling the pumps according to daily usage it was observed that she made more water in her hold than common they supposed a sword fish had stabbed her gentlemen but the captain having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes and therefore being very averse to quit them and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous though indeed they could not find it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy weather the ship still continued her cruisings the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals but no good luck came more days went by and not only was the leak yet undiscovered but it sensibly increased so much so that now taking some alarm the captain making all sail stood away for the nearest harbor among the islands there to have his hull hove out and repaired  though no small passage was before her yet if the commonest chance favoured he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way because his pumps were of the best and being periodically relieved at them those six and thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free never mind if the leak should double on her in truth well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes the town ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality had it not been for the brutal overbearing of radney the mate a vineyarder and the bitterly provoked vengeance of steelkilt a lakeman and desperado from buffalo  lakeman buffalo pray what is a lakeman and where is buffalo said don sebastian rising in his swinging mat of grass  on the eastern shore of our lake erie don but i crave your courtesy may be you shall soon hear further of all that now gentlemen in square sail brigs and three masted ships well nigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old callao to far manilla this lakeman in the land locked heart of our america had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected with the open ocean for in their interflowing aggregate those grand fresh water seas of ours erie and ontario and huron and superior and michigan possess an ocean like expansiveness with many of the ocean s noblest traits with many of its rimmed varieties of races and of climes they contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles even as the polynesian waters do in large part are shored by two great contrasting nations as the atlantic is they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the east dotted all round their banks here and there are frowned upon by batteries and by the goat like craggy guns of lofty mackinaw they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories at intervals they yield their beaches to wild barbarians whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry wigwams for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered forests where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in gothic genealogies those same woods harboring wild afric beasts of prey and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to tartar emperors they mirror the paved capitals of buffalo and cleveland as well as winnebago villages they float alike the full rigged merchant ship the armed cruiser of the state the steamer and the beech canoe they are swept by borean and dismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave they know what shipwrecks are for out of sight of land however inland they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew thus gentlemen though an inlander steelkilt was wild ocean born and wild ocean nurtured as much of an audacious mariner as any and for radney though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone nantucket beach to nurse at his maternal sea though in after life he had long followed our austere atlantic and your contemplative pacific yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman fresh from the latitudes of buck horn handled bowie knives yet was this nantucketer a man with some good hearted traits and this lakeman a mariner who though a sort of devil indeed might yet by inflexible firmness only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest slave s right thus treated this steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile at all events he had proved so thus far but radney was doomed and made mad and steelkilt but gentlemen you shall hear  it was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for her island haven that the town ho s leak seemed again increasing but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day you must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our atlantic for example some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it though of a still sleepy night should the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward gentlemen is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pump handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length that is if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them it is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters some really landless latitude that her captain begins to feel a little anxious  much this way had it been with the town ho so when her leak was found gaining once more there was in truth some small concern manifested by several of her company especially by radney the mate he commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted sheeted home anew and every way expanded to the breeze now this radney i suppose was as little of a coward and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine gentlemen therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship some of the seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in her so when they were working that evening at the pumps there was on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them as they stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water clear as any mountain spring gentlemen that bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupper holes  now as you well know it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of ours watery or otherwise that when a person placed in command over his fellow men finds one of them to be very significantly his superior in general pride of manhood straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern s tower and make a little heap of dust of it be this conceit of mine as it may gentlemen at all events steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a roman and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy s snorting charger and a brain and a heart and a soul in him gentlemen which had made steelkilt charlemagne had he been born son to charlemagne s father but radney the mate was ugly as a mule yet as hardy as stubborn as malicious he did not love steelkilt and steelkilt knew it  espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the rest the lakeman affected not to notice him but unawed went on with his gay banterings  aye aye my merry lads it s a lively leak this hold a cannikin one of ye and let s have a taste by the lord it s worth bottling i tell ye what men old rad s investment must go for it he had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home the fact is boys that sword fish only began the job he s come back again with a gang of ship carpenters saw fish and file fish and what not and the whole posse of em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom making improvements i suppose if old rad were here now i d tell him to jump overboard and scatter em they re playing the devil with his estate i can tell him but he s a simple old soul rad and a beauty too boys they say the rest of his property is invested in looking glasses i wonder if he d give a poor devil like me the model of his nose  damn your eyes what s that pump stopping for roared radney pretending not to have heard the sailors talk thunder away at it  aye aye sir said steelkilt merry as a cricket lively boys lively now and with that the pump clanged like fifty fire engines the men tossed their hats off to it and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life s utmost energies  quitting the pump at last with the rest of his band the lakeman went forward all panting and sat himself down on the windlass his face fiery red his eyes bloodshot and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow now what cozening fiend it was gentlemen that possessed radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state i know not but so it happened intolerably striding along the deck the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks and also a shovel and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large  now gentlemen sweeping a ship s deck at sea is a piece of household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every evening it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually foundering at the time such gentlemen is the inflexibility of sea usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces but in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys if boys there be aboard besides it was the stronger men in the town ho that had been divided into gangs taking turns at the pumps and being the most athletic seaman of them all steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties such being the case with his comrades i mention all these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men  but there was more than this the order about the shovel was almost as plainly meant to sting and insult steelkilt as though radney had spat in his face any man who has gone sailor in a whale ship will understand this and all this and doubtless much more the lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command but as he sat still for a moment and as he steadfastly looked into the mate s malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder casks heaped up in him and the slow match silently burning along towards them as he instinctively saw all this that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being a repugnance most felt when felt at all by really valiant men even when aggrieved this nameless phantom feeling gentlemen stole over steelkilt  therefore in his ordinary tone only a little broken by the bodily exhaustion he was temporarily in he answered him saying that sweeping the deck was not his business and he would not do it and then without at all alluding to the shovel he pointed to three lads as the customary sweepers who not being billeted at the pumps had done little or nothing all day to this radney replied with an oath in a most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command meanwhile advancing upon the still seated lakeman with an uplifted cooper s club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by  heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate but somehow still smothering the conflagration within him without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat till at last the incensed radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face furiously commanding him to do his bidding  steelkilt rose and slowly retreating round the windlass steadily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer deliberately repeated his intention not to obey seeing however that his forbearance had not the slightest effect by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man but it was to no purpose and in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass when resolved at last no longer to retreat bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor the lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer  mr radney i will not obey you take that hammer away or look to yourself but the predestinated mate coming still closer to him where the lakeman stood fixed now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions retreating not the thousandth part of an inch stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance steelkilt clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he steelkilt would murder him but gentlemen the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the gods immediately the hammer touched the cheek the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale  ere the cry could go aft steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their mastheads they were both canallers  canallers cried don pedro we have seen many whale ships in our harbours but never heard of your canallers pardon who and what are they  canallers don are the boatmen belonging to our grand erie canal you must have heard of it  nay senor hereabouts in this dull warm most lazy and hereditary land we know but little of your vigorous north  aye well then don refill my cup your chicha s very fine and ere proceeding further i will tell ye what our canallers are for such information may throw side light upon my story  for three hundred and sixty miles gentlemen through the entire breadth of the state of new york through numerous populous cities and most thriving villages through long dismal uninhabited swamps and affluent cultivated fields unrivalled for fertility by billiard room and bar room through the holy of holies of great forests on roman arches over indian rivers through sun and shade by happy hearts or broken through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble mohawk counties and especially by rows of snow white chapels whose spires stand almost like milestones flows one continual stream of venetianly corrupt and often lawless life there s your true ashantee gentlemen there howl your pagans where you ever find them next door to you under the long flung shadow and the snug patronising lee of churches for by some curious fatality as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice so sinners gentlemen most abound in holiest vicinities  is that a friar passing said don pedro looking downwards into the crowded plazza with humorous concern  well for our northern friend dame isabella s inquisition wanes in lima laughed don sebastian proceed senor  a moment pardon cried another of the company in the name of all us limeese i but desire to express to you sir sailor that we have by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present lima for distant venice in your corrupt comparison oh do not bow and look surprised you know the proverb all along this coast corrupt as lima it but bears out your saying too churches more plentiful than billiard tables and for ever open and corrupt as lima so too venice i have been there the holy city of the blessed evangelist st mark st dominic purge it your cup thanks here i refill now you pour out again  freely depicted in his own vocation gentlemen the canaller would make a fine dramatic hero so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he like mark antony for days and days along his green turfed flowery nile he indolently floats openly toying with his red cheeked cleopatra ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck but ashore all this effeminacy is dashed the brigandish guise which the canaller so proudly sports his slouched and gaily ribboned hat betoken his grand features a terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities once a vagabond on his own canal i have received good turns from one of these canallers i thank him heartily would fain be not ungrateful but it is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait as to plunder a wealthy one in sum gentlemen what the wildness of this canal life is is emphatically evinced by this that our wild whale fishery contains so many of its most finished graduates and that scarce any race of mankind except sydney men are so much distrusted by our whaling captains nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line the probationary life of the grand canal furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a christian corn field and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas  i see i see impetuously exclaimed don pedro spilling his chicha upon his silvery ruffles no need to travel the world s one lima i had thought now that at your temperate north the generations were cold and holy as the hills but the story  i left off gentlemen where the lakeman shook the backstay hardly had he done so when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the four harpooneers who all crowded him to the deck but sliding down the ropes like baleful comets the two canallers rushed into the uproar and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt and a twisted turmoil ensued while standing out of harm s way the valiant captain danced up and down with a whale pike calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel and smoke him along to the quarter deck at intervals he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion and prying into the heart of it with his pike sought to prick out the object of his resentment but steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck where hastily slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass these sea parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade  come out of that ye pirates roared the captain now menacing them with a pistol in each hand just brought to him by the steward come out of that ye cut throats  steelkilt leaped on the barricade and striding up and down there defied the worst the pistols could do but gave the captain to understand distinctly that his steelkilt s death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true the captain a little desisted but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty  will you promise not to touch us if we do demanded their ringleader  turn to turn to i make no promise to your duty do you want to sink the ship by knocking off at a time like this turn to and he once more raised a pistol  sink the ship cried steelkilt aye let her sink not a man of us turns to unless you swear not to raise a rope yarn against us what say ye men turning to his comrades a fierce cheer was their response  the lakeman now patrolled the barricade all the while keeping his eye on the captain and jerking out such sentences as these it s not our fault we didn t want it i told him to take his hammer away it was boy s business he might have known me before this i told him not to prick the buffalo i believe i have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw ain t those mincing knives down in the forecastle there men look to those handspikes my hearties captain by god look to yourself say the word don t be a fool forget it all we are ready to turn to treat us decently and we re your men but we won t be flogged  turn to i make no promises turn to i say  look ye now cried the lakeman flinging out his arm towards him there are a few of us here and i am one of them who have shipped for the cruise d ye see now as you well know sir we can claim our discharge as soon as the anchor is down so we don t want a row it s not our interest we want to be peaceable we are ready to work but we won t be flogged  turn to roared the captain  steelkilt glanced round him a moment and then said i tell you what it is now captain rather than kill ye and be hung for such a shabby rascal we won t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us but till you say the word about not flogging us we don t do a hand s turn  down into the forecastle then down with ye i ll keep ye there till ye re sick of it down ye go  shall we cried the ringleader to his men most of them were against it but at length in obedience to steelkilt they preceded him down into their dark den growlingly disappearing like bears into a cave  as the lakeman s bare head was just level with the planks the captain and his posse leaped the barricade and rapidly drawing over the slide of the scuttle planted their group of hands upon it and loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway then opening the slide a little the captain whispered something down the crack closed it and turned the key upon them ten in number leaving on deck some twenty or more who thus far had remained neutral  all night a wide awake watch was kept by all the officers forward and aft especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway at which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge after breaking through the bulkhead below but the hours of darkness passed in peace the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship  at sunrise the captain went forward and knocking on the deck summoned the prisoners to work but with a yell they refused water was then lowered down to them and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after it when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it the captain returned to the quarter deck twice every day for three days this was repeated but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling and then a scuffling was heard as the customary summons was delivered and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle saying they were ready to turn to the fetid closeness of the air and a famishing diet united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution had constrained them to surrender at discretion emboldened by this the captain reiterated his demand to the rest but steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged on the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain them only three were left  better turn to now said the captain with a heartless jeer  shut us up again will ye cried steelkilt  oh certainly said the captain and the key clicked  it was at this point gentlemen that enraged by the defection of seven of his former associates and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of despair it was then that steelkilt proposed to the two canallers thus far apparently of one mind with him to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison and armed with their keen mincing knives long crescentic heavy implements with a handle at each end run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail and if by any devilishness of desperation possible seize the ship for himself he would do this he said whether they joined him or not that was the last night he should spend in that den but the scheme met with no opposition on the part of the other two they swore they were ready for that or for any other mad thing for anything in short but a surrender and what was more they each insisted upon being the first man on deck when the time to make the rush should come but to this their leader as fiercely objected reserving that priority for himself particularly as his two comrades would not yield the one to the other in the matter and both of them could not be first for the ladder would but admit one man at a time and here gentlemen the foul play of these miscreants must come out  upon hearing the frantic project of their leader each in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted it would seem upon the same piece of treachery namely to be foremost in breaking out in order to be the first of the three though the last of the ten to surrender and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit but when steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last they in some way by some subtle chemistry of villany mixed their before secret treacheries together and when their leader fell into a doze verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences and bound the sleeper with cords and gagged him with cords and shrieked out for the captain at midnight  thinking murder at hand and smelling in the dark for the blood he and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle in a few minutes the scuttle was opened and bound hand and foot the still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder but all these were collared and dragged along the deck like dead cattle and side by side were seized up into the mizzen rigging like three quarters of meat and there they hung till morning damn ye cried the captain pacing to and fro before them the vultures would not touch ye ye villains  at sunrise he summoned all hands and separating those who had rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny he told the former that he had a good mind to flog them all round thought upon the whole he would do so he ought to justice demanded it but for the present considering their timely surrender he would let them go with a reprimand which he accordingly administered in the vernacular  but as for you ye carrion rogues turning to the three men in the rigging for you i mean to mince ye up for the try pots and seizing a rope he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two traitors till they yelled no more but lifelessly hung their heads sideways as the two crucified thieves are drawn  my wrist is sprained with ye he cried at last but there is still rope enough left for you my fine bantam that wouldn t give up take that gag from his mouth and let us hear what he can say for himself  for a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his cramped jaws and then painfully twisting round his head said in a sort of hiss what i say is this and mind it well if you flog me i murder you  say ye so then see how ye frighten me and the captain drew off with the rope to strike  best not hissed the lakeman  but i must and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke  steelkilt here hissed out something inaudible to all but the captain who to the amazement of all hands started back paced the deck rapidly two or three times and then suddenly throwing down his rope said i won t do it let him go cut him down d ye hear  but as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order a pale man with a bandaged head arrested them radney the chief mate ever since the blow he had lain in his berth but that morning hearing the tumult on the deck he had crept out and thus far had watched the whole scene such was the state of his mouth that he could hardly speak but mumbling something about _his_ being willing and able to do what the captain dared not attempt he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe  you are a coward hissed the lakeman  so i am but take that the mate was in the very act of striking when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm he paused and then pausing no more made good his word spite of steelkilt s threat whatever that might have been the three men were then cut down all hands were turned to and sullenly worked by the moody seamen the iron pumps clanged as before  just after dark that day when one watch had retired below a clamor was heard in the forecastle and the two trembling traitors running up besieged the cabin door saying they durst not consort with the crew entreaties cuffs and kicks could not drive them back so at their own instance they were put down in the ship s run for salvation still no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest on the contrary it seemed that mainly at steelkilt s instigation they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness obey all orders to the last and when the ship reached port desert her in a body but in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage they all agreed to another thing namely not to sing out for whales in case any should be discovered for spite of her leak and spite of all her other perils the town ho still maintained her mast heads and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground and radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale  but though the lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct he kept his own counsel at least till all was over concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart he was in radney the chief mate s watch and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom after the scene at the rigging he insisted against the express counsel of the captain upon resuming the head of his watch at night upon this and one or two other circumstances steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge  during the night radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarter deck and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there a little above the ship s side in this attitude it was well known he sometimes dozed there was a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship and down between this was the sea steelkilt calculated his time and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two o clock in the morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed at his leisure he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his watches below  what are you making there said a shipmate  what do you think what does it look like  like a lanyard for your bag but it s an odd one seems to me  yes rather oddish said the lakeman holding it at arm s length before him but i think it will answer shipmate i haven t enough twine have you any  but there was none in the forecastle  then i must get some from old rad and he rose to go aft  you don t mean to go a begging to _him _ said a sailor  why not do you think he won t do me a turn when it s to help himself in the end shipmate and going to the mate he looked at him quietly and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock it was given him neither twine nor lanyard were seen again but the next night an iron ball closely netted partly rolled from the pocket of the lakeman s monkey jacket as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow twenty four hours after his trick at the silent helm nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seaman s hand that fatal hour was then to come and in the fore ordaining soul of steelkilt the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse with his forehead crushed in  but gentlemen a fool saved the would be murderer from the bloody deed he had planned yet complete revenge he had and without being the avenger for by a mysterious fatality heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have done  it was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day when they were washing down the decks that a stupid teneriffe man drawing water in the main chains all at once shouted out there she rolls there she rolls jesu what a whale it was moby dick  moby dick cried don sebastian st dominic sir sailor but do whales have christenings whom call you moby dick  a very white and famous and most deadly immortal monster don but that would be too long a story  how how cried all the young spaniards crowding  nay dons dons nay nay i cannot rehearse that now let me get more into the air sirs  the chicha the chicha cried don pedro our vigorous friend looks faint fill up his empty glass  no need gentlemen one moment and i proceed now gentlemen so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the ship forgetful of the compact among the crew in the excitement of the moment the teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the monster though for some little time past it had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast heads all was now a phrensy the white whale the white whale was the cry from captain mates and harpooneers who undeterred by fearful rumours were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish while the dogged crew eyed askance and with curses the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea gentlemen a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these events as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted the mutineer was the bowsman of the mate and when fast to a fish it was his duty to sit next him while radney stood up with his lance in the prow and haul in or slacken the line at the word of command moreover when the four boats were lowered the mate s got the start and none howled more fiercely with delight than did steelkilt as he strained at his oar after a stiff pull their harpooneer got fast and spear in hand radney sprang to the bow he was always a furious man it seems in a boat and now his bandaged cry was to beach him on the whale s topmost back nothing loath his bowsman hauled him up and up through a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together till of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge and keeling over spilled out the standing mate that instant as he fell on the whale s slippery back the boat righted and was dashed aside by the swell while radney was tossed over into the sea on the other flank of the whale he struck out through the spray and for an instant was dimly seen through that veil wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of moby dick but the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom seized the swimmer between his jaws and rearing high up with him plunged headlong again and went down  meantime at the first tap of the boat s bottom the lakeman had slackened the line so as to drop astern from the whirlpool calmly looking on he thought his own thoughts but a sudden terrific downward jerking of the boat quickly brought his knife to the line he cut it and the whale was free but at some distance moby dick rose again with some tatters of radney s red woollen shirt caught in the teeth that had destroyed him all four boats gave chase again but the whale eluded them and finally wholly disappeared  in good time the town ho reached her port a savage solitary place where no civilized creature resided there headed by the lakeman all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms eventually as it turned out seizing a large double war canoe of the savages and setting sail for some other harbor  the ship s company being reduced to but a handful the captain called upon the islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak but to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated both by night and by day and so extreme was the hard work they underwent that upon the vessel being ready again for sea they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel after taking counsel with his officers he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows stacked his muskets on the poop and warning the islanders not to approach the ship at their peril took one man with him and setting the sail of his best whale boat steered straight before the wind for tahiti five hundred miles distant to procure a reinforcement to his crew  on the fourth day of the sail a large canoe was descried which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals he steered away from it but the savage craft bore down on him and soon the voice of steelkilt hailed him to heave to or he would run him under water the captain presented a pistol with one foot on each prow of the yoked war canoes the lakeman laughed him to scorn assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock he would bury him in bubbles and foam  what do you want of me cried the captain  where are you bound and for what are you bound demanded steelkilt no lies  i am bound to tahiti for more men  very good let me board you a moment i come in peace with that he leaped from the canoe swam to the boat and climbing the gunwale stood face to face with the captain  cross your arms sir throw back your head now repeat after me as soon as steelkilt leaves me i swear to beach this boat on yonder island and remain there six days if i do not may lightnings strike me  a pretty scholar laughed the lakeman adios senor and leaping into the sea he swam back to his comrades  watching the boat till it was fairly beached and drawn up to the roots of the cocoa nut trees steelkilt made sail again and in due time arrived at tahiti his own place of destination there luck befriended him two ships were about to sail for france and were providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed they embarked and so for ever got the start of their former captain had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution  some ten days after the french ships sailed the whale boat arrived and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized tahitians who had been somewhat used to the sea chartering a small native schooner he returned with them to his vessel and finding all right there again resumed his cruisings  where steelkilt now is gentlemen none know but upon the island of nantucket the widow of radney still turns to the sea which refuses to give up its dead still in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed him  are you through said don sebastian quietly  i am don  then i entreat you tell me if to the best of your own convictions this your story is in substance really true it is so passing wonderful did you get it from an unquestionable source bear with me if i seem to press  also bear with all of us sir sailor for
