chapter 57 of whales in paint in teeth in wood in sheet iron in stone in mountains in stars  on tower hill as you go down to the london docks you may have seen a crippled beggar or _kedger_ as the sailors say holding a painted board before him representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg there are three whales and three boats and one of the boats presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity is being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale any time these ten years they tell me has that man held up that picture and exhibited that stump to an incredulous world but the time of his justification has now come his three whales are as good whales as were ever published in wapping at any rate and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the western clearings but though for ever mounted on that stump never a stump speech does the poor whaleman make but with downcast eyes stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation  throughout the pacific and also in nantucket and new bedford and sag harbor you will come across lively sketches of whales and whaling scenes graven by the fishermen themselves on sperm whale teeth or ladies busks wrought out of the right whale bone and other like skrimshander articles as the whalemen call the numerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough material in their hours of ocean leisure some of them have little boxes of dentistical looking implements specially intended for the skrimshandering business but in general they toil with their jack knives alone and with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor they will turn you out anything you please in the way of a mariner s fancy  long exile from christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man to that condition in which god placed him _i e _ what is called savagery your true whale hunter is as much a savage as an iroquois i myself am a savage owning no allegiance but to the king of the cannibals and ready at any moment to rebel against him  now one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic hours is his wonderful patience of industry an ancient hawaiian war club or spear paddle in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a latin lexicon for with but a bit of broken sea shell or a shark s tooth that miraculous intricacy of wooden net work has been achieved and it has cost steady years of steady application  as with the hawaiian savage so with the white sailor savage with the same marvellous patience and with the same single shark s tooth of his one poor jack knife he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture not quite as workmanlike but as close packed in its maziness of design as the greek savage achilles s shield and full of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness as the prints of that fine old dutch savage albert durer  wooden whales or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the noble south sea war wood are frequently met with in the forecastles of american whalers some of them are done with much accuracy  at some old gable roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by the tail for knockers to the road side door when the porter is sleepy the anvil headed whale would be best but these knocking whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays on the spires of some old fashioned churches you will see sheet iron whales placed there for weather cocks but they are so elevated and besides that are to all intents and purposes so labelled with _hands off _ you cannot examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit  in bony ribby regions of the earth where at the base of high broken cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the leviathan partly merged in grass which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf of green surges  then again in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights here and there from some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges but you must be a thorough whaleman to see these sights and not only that but if you wish to return to such a sight again you must be sure and take the exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first stand point else so chance like are such observations of the hills that your precise previous stand point would require a laborious re discovery like the soloma islands which still remain incognita though once high ruffed mendanna trod them and old figuera chronicled them  nor when expandingly lifted by your subject can you fail to trace out great whales in the starry heavens and boats in pursuit of them as when long filled with thoughts of war the eastern nations saw armies locked in battle among the clouds thus at the north have i chased leviathan round and round the pole with the revolutions of the bright points that first defined him to me and beneath the effulgent antarctic skies i have boarded the argo navis and joined the chase against the starry cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of hydrus and the flying fish  with a frigate s anchors for my bridle bitts and fasces of harpoons for spurs would i could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies to see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie encamped beyond my mortal sight
