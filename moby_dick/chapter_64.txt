chapter 61 stubb kills a whale  if to starbuck the apparition of the squid was a thing of portents to queequeg it was quite a different object  when you see him quid said the savage honing his harpoon in the bow of his hoisted boat then you quick see him parm whale  the next day was exceedingly still and sultry and with nothing special to engage them the pequod s crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea for this part of the indian ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground that is it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises dolphins flying fish and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters than those off the rio de la plata or the in shore ground off peru  it was my turn to stand at the foremast head and with my shoulders leaning against the slackened royal shrouds to and fro i idly swayed in what seemed an enchanted air no resolution could withstand it in that dreamy mood losing all consciousness at last my soul went out of my body though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn  ere forgetfulness altogether came over me i had noticed that the seamen at the main and mizzen mast heads were already drowsy so that at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars and for every swing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman the waves too nodded their indolent crests and across the wide trance of the sea east nodded to west and the sun over all  suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes like vices my hands grasped the shrouds some invisible gracious agency preserved me with a shock i came back to life and lo close under our lee not forty fathoms off a gigantic sperm whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate his broad glossy back of an ethiopian hue glistening in the sun s rays like a mirror but lazily undulating in the trough of the sea and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapory jet the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon but that pipe poor whale was thy last as if struck by some enchanter s wand the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness and more than a score of voices from all parts of the vessel simultaneously with the three notes from aloft shouted forth the accustomed cry as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air  clear away the boats luff cried ahab and obeying his own order he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes  the sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale and ere the boats were down majestically turning he swam away to the leeward but with such a steady tranquillity and making so few ripples as he swam that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used and no man must speak but in whispers so seated like ontario indians on the gunwales of the boats we swiftly but silently paddled along the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set presently as we thus glided in chase the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up  there go flukes was the cry an announcement immediately followed by stubb s producing his match and igniting his pipe for now a respite was granted after the full interval of his sounding had elapsed the whale rose again and being now in advance of the smoker s boat and much nearer to it than to any of the others stubb counted upon the honor of the capture it was obvious now that the whale had at length become aware of his pursuers all silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use paddles were dropped and oars came loudly into play and still puffing at his pipe stubb cheered on his crew to the assault  yes a mighty change had come over the fish all alive to his jeopardy he was going head out that part obliquely projecting from the mad yeast which he brewed  it will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the entire interior of the sperm whale s enormous head consists though apparently the most massive it is by far the most buoyant part about him so that with ease he elevates it in the air and invariably does so when going at his utmost speed besides such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head and such the tapering cut water formation of the lower part that by obliquely elevating his head he thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff bowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed new york pilot boat  start her start her my men don t hurry yourselves take plenty of time but start her start her like thunder claps that s all cried stubb spluttering out the smoke as he spoke start her now give em the long and strong stroke tashtego start her tash my boy start her all but keep cool keep cool cucumbers is the word easy easy only start her like grim death and grinning devils and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves boys that s all start her  woo hoo wa hee screamed the gay header in reply raising some old war whoop to the skies as every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager indian gave  but his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild kee hee kee hee yelled daggoo straining forwards and backwards on his seat like a pacing tiger in his cage  ka la koo loo howled queequeg as if smacking his lips over a mouthful of grenadier s steak and thus with oars and yells the keels cut the sea meanwhile stubb retaining his place in the van still encouraged his men to the onset all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth like desperadoes they tugged and they strained till the welcome cry was heard stand up tashtego give it to him the harpoon was hurled stern all the oarsmen backed water the same moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists it was the magical line an instant before stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round the loggerhead whence by reason of its increased rapid circlings a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe as the line passed round and round the loggerhead so also just before reaching that point it blisteringly passed through and through both of stubb s hands from which the hand cloths or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times had accidentally dropped it was like holding an enemy s sharp two edged sword by the blade and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch  wet the line wet the line cried stubb to the tub oarsman him seated by the tub who snatching off his hat dashed sea water into it more turns were taken so that the line began holding its place the boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins stubb and tashtego here changed places stem for stern a staggering business truly in that rocking commotion  partly to show the indispensableness of this act it may here be stated that in the old dutch fishery a mop was used to dash the running line with water in many other ships a wooden piggin or bailer is set apart for that purpose your hat however is the most convenient  from the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of the boat and from its now being more tight than a harpstring you would have thought the craft had two keels one cleaving the water the other the air as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at once a continual cascade played at the bows a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake and at the slightest motion from within even but of a little finger the vibrating cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea thus they rushed each man with might and main clinging to his seat to prevent being tossed to the foam and the tall form of tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double in order to bring down his centre of gravity whole atlantics and pacifics seemed passed as they shot on their way till at length the whale somewhat slackened his flight  haul in haul in cried stubb to the bowsman and facing round towards the whale all hands began pulling the boat up to him while yet the boat was being towed on soon ranging up by his flank stubb firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat darted dart after dart into the flying fish at the word of command the boat alternately sterning out of the way of the whale s horrible wallow and then ranging up for another fling  the red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a hill his tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood which bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake the slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea sent back its reflection into every face so that they all glowed to each other like red men and all the while jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman as at every dart hauling in upon his crooked lance by the line attached to it stubb straightened it again and again by a few rapid blows against the gunwale then again and again sent it into the whale  pull up pull up he now cried to the bowsman as the waning whale relaxed in his wrath pull up close to and the boat ranged along the fish s flank when reaching far over the bow stubb slowly churned his long sharp lance into the fish and kept it there carefully churning and churning as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed and which he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out but that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of the fish and now it is struck for starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his flurry the monster horribly wallowed in his blood overwrapped himself in impenetrable mad boiling spray so that the imperilled craft instantly dropping astern had much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day  and now abating in his flurry the whale once more rolled out into view surging from side to side spasmodically dilating and contracting his spout hole with sharp cracking agonized respirations at last gush after gush of clotted red gore as if it had been the purple lees of red wine shot into the frighted air and falling back again ran dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea his heart had burst  he s dead mr stubb said daggoo  yes both pipes smoked out and withdrawing his own from his mouth stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water and for a moment stood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made
