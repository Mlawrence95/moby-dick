chapter 64 stubb s supper  stubb s whale had been killed some distance from the ship it was a calm so forming a tandem of three boats we commenced the slow business of towing the trophy to the pequod and now as we eighteen men with our thirty six arms and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert sluggish corpse in the sea and it seemed hardly to budge at all except at long intervals good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved for upon the great canal of hang ho or whatever they call it in china four or five laborers on the foot path will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along as if laden with pig lead in bulk  darkness came on but three lights up and down in the pequod s main rigging dimly guided our way till drawing nearer we saw ahab dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a moment he issued the usual orders for securing it for the night and then handing his lantern to a seaman went his way into the cabin and did not come forward again until morning  though in overseeing the pursuit of this whale captain ahab had evinced his customary activity to call it so yet now that the creature was dead some vague dissatisfaction or impatience or despair seemed working in him as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that moby dick was yet to be slain and though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship all that would not one jot advance his grand monomaniac object very soon you would have thought from the sound on the pequod s decks that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck and thrust rattling out of the port holes but by those clanking links the vast corpse itself not the ship is to be moored tied by the head to the stern and by the tail to the bows the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel s and seen through the darkness of the night which obscured the spars and rigging aloft the two ship and whale seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks whereof one reclines while the other remains standing  a little item may as well be related here the strongest and most reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside is by the flukes or tail and as from its greater density that part is relatively heavier than any other excepting the side fins its flexibility even in death causes it to sink low beneath the surface so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat in order to put the chain round it but this difficulty is ingeniously overcome a small strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end and a weight in its middle while the other end is secured to the ship by adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass so that now having girdled the whale the chain is readily made to follow suit and being slipped along the body is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail at the point of junction with its broad flukes or lobes  if moody ahab was now all quiescence at least so far as could be known on deck stubb his second mate flushed with conquest betrayed an unusual but still good natured excitement such an unwonted bustle was he in that the staid starbuck his official superior quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management of affairs one small helping cause of all this liveliness in stubb was soon made strangely manifest stubb was a high liver he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate  a steak a steak ere i sleep you daggoo overboard you go and cut me one from his small  here be it known that though these wild fishermen do not as a general thing and according to the great military maxim make the enemy defray the current expenses of the war at least before realizing the proceeds of the voyage yet now and then you find some of these nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the sperm whale designated by stubb comprising the tapering extremity of the body  about midnight that steak was cut and cooked and lighted by two lanterns of sperm oil stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper at the capstan head as if that capstan were a sideboard nor was stubb the only banqueter on whale s flesh that night mingling their mumblings with his own mastications thousands on thousands of sharks swarming round the dead leviathan smackingly feasted on its fatness the few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull within a few inches of the sleepers hearts peering over the side you could just see them as before you heard them wallowing in the sullen black waters and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head this particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous how at such an apparently unassailable surface they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls remains a part of the universal problem of all things the mark they thus leave on the whale may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw  though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea fight sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship s decks like hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them and though while the valiant butchers over the deck table are thus cannibally carving each other s live meat with carving knives all gilded and tasselled the sharks also with their jewel hilted mouths are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat and though were you to turn the whole affair upside down it would still be pretty much the same thing that is to say a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the atlantic systematically trotting alongside to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere or a dead slave to be decently buried and though one or two other like instances might be set down touching the set terms places and occasions when sharks do most socially congregate and most hilariously feast yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless numbers and in gayer or more jovial spirits than around a dead sperm whale moored by night to a whaleship at sea if you have never seen that sight then suspend your decision about the propriety of devil worship and the expediency of conciliating the devil  but as yet stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was going on so nigh him no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his own epicurean lips  cook cook where s that old fleece he cried at length widening his legs still further as if to form a more secure base for his supper and at the same time darting his fork into the dish as if stabbing with his lance cook you cook sail this way cook  the old black not in any very high glee at having been previously roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour came shambling along from his galley for like many old blacks there was something the matter with his knee pans which he did not keep well scoured like his other pans this old fleece as they called him came shuffling and limping along assisting his step with his tongs which after a clumsy fashion were made of straightened iron hoops this old ebony floundered along and in obedience to the word of command came to a dead stop on the opposite side of stubb s sideboard when with both hands folded before him and resting on his two legged cane he bowed his arched back still further over at the same time sideways inclining his head so as to bring his best ear into play  cook said stubb rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his mouth don t you think this steak is rather overdone you ve been beating this steak too much cook it s too tender don t i always say that to be good a whale steak must be tough there are those sharks now over the side don t you see they prefer it tough and rare what a shindy they are kicking up cook go and talk to em tell em they are welcome to help themselves civilly and in moderation but they must keep quiet blast me if i can hear my own voice away cook and deliver my message here take this lantern snatching one from his sideboard now then go and preach to em  sullenly taking the offered lantern old fleece limped across the deck to the bulwarks and then with one hand dropping his light low over the sea so as to get a good view of his congregation with the other hand he solemnly flourished his tongs and leaning far over the side in a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks while stubb softly crawling behind overheard all that was said  fellow critters i se ordered

particular attention  all dention said fleece again stooping over upon his tongs in the desired position  well said stubb helping himself freely meanwhile i shall now go back to the subject of this steak in the first place how old are you cook  what dat do wid de teak said the old black testily  silence how old are you cook  bout ninety dey say he gloomily muttered  and you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years cook and don t know yet how to cook a whale steak rapidly bolting another mouthful at the last word so that morsel seemed a continuation of the question where were

tongs towards him take it and taste it  faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment the old negro muttered best cooked teak i eber taste joosy berry joosy  cook said stubb squaring himself once more do you belong to the church  passed one once in cape down said the old man sullenly  and you have once in your life passed a holy church in cape town where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as his beloved fellow creatures have you cook and yet you come here and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now eh said stubb where do you expect to go to cook
