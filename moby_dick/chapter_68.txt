chapter 65 the whale as a dish  that mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp and like stubb eat him by his own light as you may say this seems so outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and philosophy of it  it is upon record that three centuries ago the tongue of the right whale was esteemed a great delicacy in france and commanded large prices there also that in henry viiith s time a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises which you remember are a species of whale porpoises indeed are to this day considered fine eating the meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle balls or veal balls the old monks of dunfermline were very fond of them they had a great porpoise grant from the crown  the fact is that among his hunters at least the whale would by all hands be considered a noble dish were there not so much of him but when you come to sit down before a meat pie nearly one hundred feet long it takes away your appetite only the most unprejudiced of men like stubb nowadays partake of cooked whales but the esquimaux are not so fastidious we all know how they live upon whales and have rare old vintages of prime old train oil zogranda one of their most famous doctors recommends strips of blubber for infants as being exceedingly juicy and nourishing and this reminds me that certain englishmen who long ago were accidentally left in greenland by a whaling vessel that these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber among the dutch whalemen these scraps are called fritters which indeed they greatly resemble being brown and crisp and smelling something like old amsterdam housewives dough nuts or oly cooks when fresh they have such an eatable look that the most self denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off  but what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish is his exceeding richness he is the great prize ox of the sea too fat to be delicately good look at his hump which would be as fine eating as the buffalo s which is esteemed a rare dish were it not such a solid pyramid of fat but the spermaceti itself how bland and creamy that is like the transparent half jellied white meat of a cocoanut in the third month of its growth yet far too rich to supply a substitute for butter nevertheless many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other substance and then partaking of it in the long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their ship biscuit into the huge oil pots and let them fry there awhile many a good supper have i thus made  in the case of a small sperm whale the brains are accounted a fine dish the casket of the skull is broken into with an axe and the two plump whitish lobes being withdrawn precisely resembling two large puddings they are then mixed with flour and cooked into a most delectable mess in flavor somewhat resembling calves head which is quite a dish among some epicures and every one knows that some young bucks among the epicures by continually dining upon calves brains by and by get to have a little brains of their own so as to be able to tell a calf s head from their own heads which indeed requires uncommon discrimination and that is the reason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calf s head before him is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see the head looks a sort of reproachfully at him with an et tu brute expression  it is not perhaps entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence that appears to result in some way from the consideration before mentioned _i e _ that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea and eat it too by its own light but no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer perhaps he was hung and if he had been put on his trial by oxen he certainly would have been and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does go to the meat market of a saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal s jaw cannibals who is not a cannibal i tell you it will be more tolerable for the fejee that salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine it will be more tolerable for that provident fejee i say in the day of judgment than for thee civilized and enlightened gourmand who nailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy pat√© de foie gras  but stubb he eats the whale by its own light does he and that is adding insult to injury is it look at your knife handle there my civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef what is that handle made of what but the bones of the brother of the very ox you are eating and what do you pick your teeth with after devouring that fat goose with a feather of the same fowl and with what quill did the secretary of the society for the suppression of cruelty to ganders formally indite his circulars it is only within the last month or two that that society passed a resolution to patronize nothing but steel pens
