chapter 71 the jeroboam s story  hand in hand ship and breeze blew on but the breeze came faster than the ship and soon the pequod began to rock  by and by through the glass the stranger s boats and manned mast heads proved her a whale ship but as she was so far to windward and shooting by apparently making a passage to some other ground the pequod could not hope to reach her so the signal was set to see what response would be made  here be it said that like the vessels of military marines the ships of the american whale fleet have each a private signal all which signals being collected in a book with the names of the respective vessels attached every captain is provided with it thereby the whale commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean even at considerable distances and with no small facility  the pequod s signal was at last responded to by the stranger s setting her own which proved the ship to be the jeroboam of nantucket squaring her yards she bore down ranged abeam under the pequod s lee and lowered a boat it soon drew nigh but as the side ladder was being rigged by starbuck s order to accommodate the visiting captain the stranger in question waved his hand from his boat s stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary it turned out that the jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board and that mayhew her captain was fearful of infecting the pequod s company for though himself and boat s crew remained untainted and though his ship was half a rifle shot off and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the pequod  but this did by no means prevent all communications preserving an interval of some few yards between itself and the ship the jeroboam s boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the pequod as she heavily forged through the sea for by this time it blew very fresh with her main topsail aback though indeed at times by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave the boat would be pushed some way ahead but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings again subject to this and other the like interruptions now and then a conversation was sustained between the two parties but at intervals not without still another interruption of a very different sort  pulling an oar in the jeroboam s boat was a man of a singular appearance even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities make up all totalities he was a small short youngish man sprinkled all over his face with freckles and wearing redundant yellow hair a long skirted cabalistically cut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped him the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists a deep settled fanatic delirium was in his eyes  so soon as this figure had been first descried stubb had exclaimed that s he that s he the long togged scaramouch the town ho s company told us of stubb here alluded to a strange story told of the jeroboam and a certain man among her crew some time previous when the pequod spoke the town ho according to this account and what was subsequently learned it seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the jeroboam his story was this  he had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of neskyeuna shakers where he had been a great prophet in their cracked secret meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a trap door announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial which he carried in his vest pocket but which instead of containing gunpowder was supposed to be charged with laudanum a strange apostolic whim having seized him he had left neskyeuna for nantucket where with that cunning peculiar to craziness he assumed a steady common sense exterior and offered himself as a green hand candidate for the jeroboam s whaling voyage they engaged him but straightway upon the ship s getting out of sight of land his insanity broke out in a freshet he announced himself as the archangel gabriel and commanded the captain to jump overboard he published his manifesto whereby he set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and vicar general of all oceanica the unflinching earnestness with which he declared these things the dark daring play of his sleepless excited imagination and all the preternatural terrors of real delirium united to invest this gabriel in the minds of the majority of the ignorant crew with an atmosphere of sacredness moreover they were afraid of him as such a man however was not of much practical use in the ship especially as he refused to work except when he pleased the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him but apprised that that individual s intention was to land him in the first convenient port the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vials devoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition in case this intention was carried out so strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if gabriel was sent from the ship not a man of them would remain he was therefore forced to relinquish his plan nor would they permit gabriel to be any way maltreated say or do what he would so that it came to pass that gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship the consequence of all this was that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and mates and since the epidemic had broken out he carried a higher hand than ever declaring that the plague as he called it was at his sole command nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure the sailors mostly poor devils cringed and some of them fawned before him in obedience to his instructions sometimes rendering him personal homage as to a god such things may seem incredible but however wondrous they are true nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to the measureless self deception of the fanatic himself as his measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others but it is time to return to the pequod  i fear not thy epidemic man said ahab from the bulwarks to captain mayhew who stood in the boat s stern come on board  but now gabriel started to his feet  think think of the fevers yellow and bilious beware of the horrible plague  gabriel gabriel cried captain mayhew thou must either but that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead and its seethings drowned all speech  hast thou seen the white whale demanded ahab when the boat drifted back  think think of thy whale boat stoven and sunk beware of the horrible tail  i tell thee again gabriel that but again the boat tore ahead as if dragged by fiends nothing was said for some moments while a succession of riotous waves rolled by which by one of those occasional caprices of the seas were tumbling not heaving it meantime the hoisted sperm whale s head jogged about very violently and gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to warrant  when this interlude was over captain mayhew began a dark story concerning moby dick not however without frequent interruptions from gabriel whenever his name was mentioned and the crazy sea that seemed leagued with him  it seemed that the jeroboam had not long left home when upon speaking a whale ship her people were reliably apprised of the existence of moby dick and the havoc he had made greedily sucking in this intelligence gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the white whale in case the monster should be seen in his gibbering insanity pronouncing the white whale to be no less a being than the shaker god incarnated the shakers receiving the bible but when some year or two afterwards moby dick was fairly sighted from the mast heads macey the chief mate burned with ardour to encounter him and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity despite all the archangel s denunciations and forewarnings macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat with them he pushed off and after much weary pulling and many perilous unsuccessful onsets he at last succeeded in getting one iron fast meantime gabriel ascending to the main royal mast head was tossing one arm in frantic gestures and hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity now while macey the mate was standing up in his boat s bow and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance lo a broad white shadow rose from the sea by its quick fanning motion temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen next instant the luckless mate so full of furious life was smitten bodily into the air and making a long arc in his descent fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards not a chip of the boat was harmed nor a hair of any oarsman s head but the mate for ever sank  it is well to parenthesize here that of the fatal accidents in the sperm whale fishery this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any sometimes nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated oftener the boat s bow is knocked off or the thigh board in which the headsman stands is torn from its place and accompanies the body but strangest of all is the circumstance that in more instances than one when the body has been recovered not a single mark of violence is discernible the man being stark dead  the whole calamity with the falling form of macey was plainly descried from the ship raising a piercing shriek the vial the vial gabriel called off the terror stricken crew from the further hunting of the whale this terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence because his credulous disciples believed that he had specifically fore announced it instead of only making a general prophecy which any one might have done and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the wide margin allowed he became a nameless terror to the ship  mayhew having concluded his narration ahab put such questions to him that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he intended to hunt the white whale if opportunity should offer to which ahab answered aye straightway then gabriel once more started to his feet glaring upon the old man and vehemently exclaimed with downward pointed finger think think of the blasphemer dead and down there beware of the blasphemer s end  ahab stolidly turned aside then said to mayhew captain i have just bethought me of my letter bag there is a letter for one of thy officers if i mistake not starbuck look over the bag  every whale ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans thus most letters never reach their mark and many are only received after attaining an age of two or three years or more  soon starbuck returned with a letter in his hand it was sorely tumbled damp and covered with a dull spotted green mould in consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin of such a letter death himself might well have been the post boy  can st not read it cried ahab give it me man aye aye it s but a dim scrawl what s this as he was studying it out starbuck took a long cutting spade pole and with his knife slightly split the end to insert the letter there and in that way hand it to the boat without its coming any closer to the ship  meantime ahab holding the letter muttered mr har yes mr harry a woman s pinny hand the man s wife i ll wager aye mr harry macey ship jeroboam why it s macey and he s dead  poor fellow poor fellow and from his wife sighed mayhew but let me have it  nay keep it thyself cried gabriel to ahab thou art soon going that way  curses throttle thee yelled ahab captain mayhew stand by now to receive it and taking the fatal missive from starbuck s hands he caught it in the slit of the pole and reached it over towards the boat but as he did so the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing the boat drifted a little towards the ship s stern so that as if by magic the letter suddenly ranged along with gabriel s eager hand he clutched it in an instant seized the boat knife and impaling the letter on it sent it thus loaded back into the ship it fell at ahab s feet then gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the pequod  as after this interlude the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of the whale many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild affair
