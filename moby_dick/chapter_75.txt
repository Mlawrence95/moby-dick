chapter 72 the monkey rope  in the tumultuous business of cutting in and attending to a whale there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew now hands are wanted here and then again hands are wanted there there is no staying in any one place for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere it is much the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene we must now retrace our way a little it was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale s back the blubber hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates but how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole it was inserted there by my particular friend queequeg whose duty it was as harpooneer to descend upon the monster s back for the special purpose referred to but in very many cases circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is concluded the whale be it observed lies almost entirely submerged excepting the immediate parts operated upon so down there some ten feet below the level of the deck the poor harpooneer flounders about half on the whale and half in the water as the vast mass revolves like a tread mill beneath him on the occasion in question queequeg figured in the highland costume a shirt and socks in which to my eyes at least he appeared to uncommon advantage and no one had a better chance to observe him as will presently be seen  being the savage s bowsman that is the person who pulled the bow oar in his boat the second one from forward it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hard scrabble scramble upon the dead whale s back you have seen italian organ boys holding a dancing ape by a long cord just so from the ship s steep side did i hold queequeg down there in the sea by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey rope attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist  it was a humorously perilous business for both of us for before we proceed further it must be said that the monkey rope was fast at both ends fast to queequeg s broad canvas belt and fast to my narrow leather one so that for better or for worse we two for the time were wedded and should poor queequeg sink to rise no more then both usage and honor demanded that instead of cutting the cord it should drag me down in his wake so then an elongated siamese ligature united us queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother nor could i any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed  so strongly and metaphysically did i conceive of my situation then that while earnestly watching his motions i seemed distinctly to perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two that my free will had received a mortal wound and that another s mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death therefore i saw that here was a sort of interregnum in providence for its even handed equity never could have so gross an injustice and yet still further pondering while i jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship which would threaten to jam him still further pondering i say i saw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes only in most cases he one way or other has this siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals if your banker breaks you snap if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills you die true you may say that by exceeding caution you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life but handle queequeg s monkey rope heedfully as i would sometimes he jerked it so that i came very near sliding overboard nor could i possibly forget that do what i would i only had the management of one end of it  the monkey rope is found in all whalers but it was only in the pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together this improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than stubb in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey rope holder  i have hinted that i would often jerk poor queequeg from between the whale and the ship where he would occasionally fall from the incessant rolling and swaying of both but this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the carcass the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive  and right in among those sharks was queequeg who often pushed them aside with his floundering feet a thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man  nevertheless it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous finger in the pie it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them accordingly besides the monkey rope with which i now and then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark he was provided with still another protection suspended over the side in one of the stages tashtego and daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen whale spades wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach this procedure of theirs to be sure was very disinterested and benevolent of them they meant queequeg s best happiness i admit but in their hasty zeal to befriend him and from the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood muddled water those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tail but poor queequeg i suppose straining and gasping there with that great iron hook poor queequeg i suppose only prayed to his yojo and gave up his life into the hands of his gods  well well my dear comrade and twin brother thought i as i drew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea what matters it after all are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world that unsounded ocean you gasp in is life those sharks your foes those spades your friends and what between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril poor lad  but courage there is good cheer in store for you queequeg for now as with blue lips and blood shot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side the steward advances and with a benevolent consolatory glance hands him what some hot cognac no hands him ye gods hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water  ginger do i smell ginger suspiciously asked stubb coming near yes this must be ginger peering into the as yet untasted cup then standing as if incredulous for a while he calmly walked towards the astonished steward slowly saying ginger ginger and will you have the goodness to tell me mr dough boy where lies the virtue of ginger ginger is ginger the sort of fuel you use dough boy to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal ginger what the devil is ginger sea coal firewood lucifer matches tinder gunpowder what the devil is ginger i say that you offer this cup to our poor queequeg here  there is some sneaking temperance society movement about this business he suddenly added now approaching starbuck who had just come from forward will you look at that kannakin sir smell of it if you please then watching the mate s countenance he added the steward mr starbuck had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to queequeg there this instant off the whale is the steward an apothecary sir and may i ask whether this is the sort of bitters by which he blows back the life into a half drowned man  i trust not said starbuck it is poor stuff enough  aye aye steward cried stubb we ll teach you to drug a harpooneer none of your apothecary s medicine here you want to poison us do ye you have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder us all and pocket the proceeds do ye  it was not me cried dough boy it was aunt charity that brought the ginger on board and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits but only this ginger jub so she called it  ginger jub you gingerly rascal take that and run along with ye to the lockers and get something better i hope i do no wrong mr starbuck it is the captain s orders grog for the harpooneer on a whale  enough replied starbuck only don t hit him again but  oh i never hurt when i hit except when i hit a whale or something of that sort and this fellow s a weazel what were you about saying sir  only this go down with him and get what thou wantest thyself  when stubb reappeared he came with a dark flask in one hand and a sort of tea caddy in the other the first contained strong spirits and was handed to queequeg the second was aunt charity s gift and that was freely given to the waves
