chapter 73 stubb and flask kill a right whale and then have a talk over him  it must be borne in mind that all this time we have a sperm whale s prodigious head hanging to the pequod s side but we must let it continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it for the present other matters press and the best we can do now for the head is to pray heaven the tackles may hold  now during the past night and forenoon the pequod had gradually drifted into a sea which by its occasional patches of yellow brit gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of right whales a species of the leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near and though all hands commonly disdained the capture of those inferior creatures and though the pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them at all and though she had passed numbers of them near the crozetts without lowering a boat yet now that a sperm whale had been brought alongside and beheaded to the surprise of all the announcement was made that a right whale should be captured that day if opportunity offered  nor was this long wanting tall spouts were seen to leeward and two boats stubb s and flask s were detached in pursuit pulling further and further away they at last became almost invisible to the men at the mast head but suddenly in the distance they saw a great heap of tumultuous white water and soon after news came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast an interval passed and the boats were in plain sight in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the towing whale so close did the monster come to the hull that at first it seemed as if he meant it malice but suddenly going down in a maelstrom within three rods of the planks he wholly disappeared from view as if diving under the keel cut cut was the cry from the ship to the boats which for one instant seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessel s side but having plenty of line yet in the tubs and the whale not sounding very rapidly they paid out abundance of rope and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship for a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical for while they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction and still plied their oars in another the contending strain threatened to take them under but it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain and they stuck to it till they did gain it when instantly a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel as the strained line scraping beneath the ship suddenly rose to view under her bows snapping and quivering and so flinging off its drippings that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water while the whale beyond also rose to sight and once more the boats were free to fly but the fagged whale abated his speed and blindly altering his course went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after him so that they performed a complete circuit  meantime they hauled more and more upon their lines till close flanking him on both sides stubb answered flask with lance for lance and thus round and round the pequod the battle went while the multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the sperm whale s body rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled thirstily drinking at every new gash as the eager israelites did at the new bursting fountains that poured from the smitten rock  at last his spout grew thick and with a frightful roll and vomit he turned upon his back a corpse  while the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing some conversation ensued between them  i wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard said stubb not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a leviathan  wants with it said flask coiling some spare line in the boat s bow did you never hear that the ship which but once has a sperm whale s head hoisted on her starboard side and at the same time a right whale s on the larboard did you never hear stubb that that ship can never afterwards capsize  why not  i don t know but i heard that gamboge ghost of a fedallah saying so and he seems to know all about ships charms but i sometimes think he ll charm the ship to no good at last i don t half like that chap stubb did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snake s head stubb  sink him i never look at him at all but if ever i get a chance of a dark night and he standing hard by the bulwarks and no one by look down there flask pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both hands aye will i flask i take that fedallah to be the devil in disguise do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been stowed away on board ship he s the devil i say the reason why you don t see his tail is because he tucks it up out of sight he carries it coiled away in his pocket i guess blast him now that i think of it he s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots  he sleeps in his boots don t he he hasn t got any hammock but i ve seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging  no doubt and it s because of his cursed tail he coils it down do ye see in the eye of the rigging  what s the old man have so much to do with him for  striking up a swap or a bargain i suppose  bargain about what  why do ye see the old man is hard bent after that white whale and the devil there is trying to come round him and get him to swap away his silver watch or his soul or something of that sort and then he ll surrender moby dick  pooh stubb you are skylarking how can fedallah do that  i don t know flask but the devil is a curious chap and a wicked one i tell ye why they say as how he went a sauntering into the old flag ship once switching his tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike and inquiring if the old governor was at home well he was at home and asked the devil what he wanted the devil switching his hoofs up and says i want john what for says the old governor what business is that of yours says the devil getting mad i want to use him take him says the governor and by the lord flask if the devil didn t give john the asiatic cholera before he got through with him i ll eat this whale in one mouthful but look sharp ain t you all ready there well then pull ahead and let s get the whale alongside  i think i remember some such story as you were telling said flask when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the ship but i can t remember where  three spaniards adventures of those three bloody minded soldadoes did ye read it there flask i guess ye did  no never saw such a book heard of it though but now tell me stubb do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now was the same you say is now on board the pequod  am i the same man that helped kill this whale doesn t the devil live for ever who ever heard that the devil was dead did you ever see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil and if the devil has a latch key to get into the admiral s cabin don t you suppose he can crawl into a porthole tell me that mr flask  how old do you suppose fedallah is stubb  do you see that mainmast there pointing to the ship well that s the figure one now take all the hoops in the pequod s hold and string along in a row with that mast for oughts do you see well that wouldn t begin to be fedallah s age nor all the coopers in creation couldn t show hoops enough to make oughts enough  but see here stubb i thought you a little boasted just now that you meant to give fedallah a sea toss if you got a good chance now if he s so old as all those hoops of yours come to and if he is going to live for ever what good will it do to pitch him overboard tell me that  give him a good ducking anyhow  but he d crawl back  duck him again and keep ducking him  suppose he should take it into his head to duck you though yes and drown you what then  i should like to see him try it i d give him such a pair of black eyes that he wouldn t dare to show his face in the admiral s cabin again for a long while let alone down in the orlop there where he lives and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much damn the devil flask so you suppose i m afraid of the devil who s afraid of him except the old governor who daresn t catch him and put him in double darbies as he deserves but lets him go about kidnapping people aye and signed a bond with him that all the people the devil kidnapped he d roast for him there s a governor  do you suppose fedallah wants to kidnap captain ahab  do i suppose it you ll know it before long flask but i am going now to keep a sharp look out on him and if i see anything very suspicious going on i ll just take him by the nape of his neck and say look here beelzebub you don t do it and if he makes any fuss by the lord i ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail take it to the capstan and give him such a wrenching and heaving that his tail will come short off at the stump do you see and then i rather guess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion he ll sneak off without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs  and what will you do with the tail stubb  do with it sell it for an ox whip when we get home what else  now do you mean what you say and have been saying all along stubb  mean or not mean here we are at the ship  the boats were here hailed to tow the whale on the larboard side where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing him  didn t i tell you so said flask yes you ll soon see this right whale s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti s  in good time flask s saying proved true as before the pequod steeply leaned over towards the sperm whale s head now by the counterpoise of both heads she regained her even keel though sorely strained you may well believe so when on one side you hoist in locke s head you go over that way but now on the other side hoist in kant s and you come back again but in very poor plight thus some minds for ever keep trimming boat oh ye foolish throw all these thunder heads overboard and then you will float light and right  in disposing of the body of a right whale when brought alongside the ship the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case of a sperm whale only in the latter instance the head is cut off whole but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the crown piece but nothing like this in the present case had been done the carcases of both whales had dropped astern and the head laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of overburdening panniers  meantime fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale s head and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand and ahab chanced so to stand that the parsee occupied his shadow while if the parsee s shadow was there at all it seemed only to blend with and lengthen ahab s as the crew toiled on laplandish speculations were bandied among them concerning all these passing things
