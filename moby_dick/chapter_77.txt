chapter 74 the sperm whale s head contrasted view  here now are two great whales laying their heads together let us join them and lay together our own  of the grand order of folio leviathans the sperm whale and the right whale are by far the most noteworthy they are the only whales regularly hunted by man to the nantucketer they present the two extremes of all the known varieties of the whale as the external difference between them is mainly observable in their heads and as a head of each is this moment hanging from the pequod s side and as we may freely go from one to the other by merely stepping across the deck where i should like to know will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology than here  in the first place you are struck by the general contrast between these heads both are massive enough in all conscience but there is a certain mathematical symmetry in the sperm whale s which the right whale s sadly lacks there is more character in the sperm whale s head as you behold it you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him in point of pervading dignity in the present instance too this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit giving token of advanced age and large experience in short he is what the fishermen technically call a grey headed whale  let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads namely the two most important organs the eye and the ear far back on the side of the head and low down near the angle of either whale s jaw if you narrowly search you will at last see a lashless eye which you would fancy to be a young colt s eye so out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head  now from this peculiar sideway position of the whale s eyes it is plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead no more than he can one exactly astern in a word the position of the whale s eyes corresponds to that of a man s ears and you may fancy for yourself how it would fare with you did you sideways survey objects through your ears you would find that you could only command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side line of sight and about thirty more behind it if your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you with dagger uplifted in broad day you would not be able to see him any more than if he were stealing upon you from behind in a word you would have two backs so to speak but at the same time also two fronts side fronts for what is it that makes the front of a man what indeed but his eyes  moreover while in most other animals that i can now think of the eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power so as to produce one picture and not two to the brain the peculiar position of the whale s eyes effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid head which towers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes in valleys this of course must wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts the whale therefore must see one distinct picture on this side and another distinct picture on that side while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him man may in effect be said to look out on the world from a sentry box with two joined sashes for his window but with the whale these two sashes are separately inserted making two distinct windows but sadly impairing the view this peculiarity of the whale s eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery and to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes  a curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this visual matter as touching the leviathan but i must be content with a hint so long as a man s eyes are open in the light the act of seeing is involuntary that is he cannot then help mechanically seeing whatever objects are before him nevertheless any one s experience will teach him that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance it is quite impossible for him attentively and completely to examine any two things however large or however small at one and the same instant of time never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other but if you now come to separate these two objects and surround each by a circle of profound darkness then in order to see one of them in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness how is it then with the whale true both his eyes in themselves must simultaneously act but is his brain so much more comprehensive combining and subtle than man s that he can at the same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects one on one side of him and the other in an exactly opposite direction if he can then is it as marvellous a thing in him as if a man were able simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct problems in euclid nor strictly investigated is there any incongruity in this comparison  it may be but an idle whim but it has always seemed to me that the extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset by three or four boats the timidity and liability to queer frights so common to such whales i think that all this indirectly proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition in which their divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them  but the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye if you are an entire stranger to their race you might hunt over these two heads for hours and never discover that organ the ear has no external leaf whatever and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill so wondrously minute is it it is lodged a little behind the eye with respect to their ears this important difference is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right while the ear of the former has an external opening that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a membrane so as to be quite imperceptible from without  is it not curious that so vast a being as the whale should see the world through so small an eye and hear the thunder through an ear which is smaller than a hare s but if his eyes were broad as the lens of herschel s great telescope and his ears capacious as the porches of cathedrals would that make him any longer of sight or sharper of hearing not at all why then do you try to enlarge your mind subtilize it  let us now with whatever levers and steam engines we have at hand cant over the sperm whale s head that it may lie bottom up then ascending by a ladder to the summit have a peep down the mouth and were it not that the body is now completely separated from it with a lantern we might descend into the great kentucky mammoth cave of his stomach but let us hold on here by this tooth and look about us where we are what a really beautiful and chaste looking mouth from floor to ceiling lined or rather papered with a glistening white membrane glossy as bridal satins  but come out now and look at this portentous lower jaw which seems like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff box with the hinge at one end instead of one side if you pry it up so as to get it overhead and expose its rows of teeth it seems a terrific portcullis and such alas it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force but far more terrible is it to behold when fathoms down in the sea you see some sulky whale floating there suspended with his prodigious jaw some fifteen feet long hanging straight down at right angles with his body for all the world like a ship s jib boom this whale is not dead he is only dispirited out of sorts perhaps hypochondriac and so supine that the hinges of his jaw have relaxed leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight a reproach to all his tribe who must no doubt imprecate lock jaws upon him  in most cases this lower jaw being easily unhinged by a practised artist is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting the ivory teeth and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles including canes umbrella stocks and handles to riding whips  with a long weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board as if it were an anchor and when the proper time comes some few days after the other work queequeg daggoo and tashtego being all accomplished dentists are set to drawing teeth with a keen cutting spade queequeg lances the gums then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts and a tackle being rigged from aloft they drag out these teeth as michigan oxen drag stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands there are generally forty two teeth in all in old whales much worn down but undecayed nor filled after our artificial fashion the jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs and piled away like joists for building houses
