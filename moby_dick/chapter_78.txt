chapter 75 the right whale s head contrasted view  crossing the deck let us now have a good long look at the right whale s head  as in general shape the noble sperm whale s head may be compared to a roman war chariot especially in front where it is so broadly rounded so at a broad view the right whale s head bears a rather inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot toed shoe two hundred years ago an old dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemaker s last and in this same last or shoe that old woman of the nursery tale with the swarming brood might very comfortably be lodged she and all her progeny  but as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different aspects according to your point of view if you stand on its summit and look at these two f shaped spoutholes you would take the whole head for an enormous bass viol and these spiracles the apertures in its sounding board then again if you fix your eye upon this strange crested comb like incrustation on the top of the mass this green barnacled thing which the greenlanders call the crown and the southern fishers the bonnet of the right whale fixing your eyes solely on this you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak with a bird s nest in its crotch at any rate when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on this bonnet such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you unless indeed your fancy has been fixed by the technical term crown also bestowed upon it in which case you will take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the sea whose green crown has been put together for him in this marvellous manner but if this whale be a king he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem look at that hanging lower lip what a huge sulk and pout is there a sulk and pout by carpenter s measurement about twenty feet long and five feet deep a sulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more  a great pity now that this unfortunate whale should be hare lipped the fissure is about a foot across probably the mother during an important interval was sailing down the peruvian coast when earthquakes caused the beach to gape over this lip as over a slippery threshold we now slide into the mouth upon my word were i at mackinaw i should take this to be the inside of an indian wigwam good lord is this the road that jonah went the roof is about twelve feet high and runs to a pretty sharp angle as if there were a regular ridge pole there while these ribbed arched hairy sides present us with those wondrous half vertical scimetar shaped slats of whalebone say three hundred on a side which depending from the upper part of the head or crown bone form those venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned the edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres through which the right whale strains the water and in whose intricacies he retains the small fish when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding time in the central blinds of bone as they stand in their natural order there are certain curious marks curves hollows and ridges whereby some whalemen calculate the creature s age as the age of an oak by its circular rings though the certainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable yet it has the savor of analogical probability at any rate if we yield to it we must grant a far greater age to the right whale than at first glance will seem reasonable  in old times there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies concerning these blinds one voyager in purchas calls them the wondrous whiskers inside of the whale s mouth another hogs bristles a third old gentleman in hackluyt uses the following elegant language there are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his upper _chop_ which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth  this reminds us that the right whale really has a sort of whisker or rather a moustache consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw sometimes these tufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn countenance  as every one knows these same hogs bristles fins whiskers blinds or whatever you please furnish to the ladies their busks and other stiffening contrivances but in this particular the demand has long been on the decline it was in queen anne s time that the bone was in its glory the farthingale being then all the fashion and as those ancient dames moved about gaily though in the jaws of the whale as you may say even so in a shower with the like thoughtlessness do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone  but now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment and standing in the right whale s mouth look around you afresh seeing all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about would you not think you were inside of the great haarlem organ and gazing upon its thousand pipes for a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest turkey the tongue which is glued as it were to the floor of the mouth it is very fat and tender and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting it on deck this particular tongue now before us at a passing glance i should say it was a six barreler that is it will yield you about that amount of oil  ere this you must have plainly seen the truth of what i started with that the sperm whale and the right whale have almost entirely different heads to sum up then in the right whale s there is no great well of sperm no ivory teeth at all no long slender mandible of a lower jaw like the sperm whale s nor in the sperm whale are there any of those blinds of bone no huge lower lip and scarcely anything of a tongue again the right whale has two external spout holes the sperm whale only one  look your last now on these venerable hooded heads while they yet lie together for one will soon sink unrecorded in the sea the other will not be very long in following  can you catch the expression of the sperm whale s there it is the same he died with only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded away i think his broad brow to be full of a prairie like placidity born of a speculative indifference as to death but mark the other head s expression see that amazing lower lip pressed by accident against the vessel s side so as firmly to embrace the jaw does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death this right whale i take to have been a stoic the sperm whale a platonian who might have taken up spinoza in his latter years
