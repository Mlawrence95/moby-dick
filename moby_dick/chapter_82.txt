chapter 79 the prairie  to scan the lines of his face or feel the bumps on the head of this leviathan this is a thing which no physiognomist or phrenologist has as yet undertaken such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the rock of gibraltar or for gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the dome of the pantheon still in that famous work of his lavater not only treats of the various faces of men but also attentively studies the faces of horses birds serpents and fish and dwells in detail upon the modifications of expression discernible therein nor have gall and his disciple spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the phrenological characteristics of other beings than man therefore though i am but ill qualified for a pioneer in the application of these two semi sciences to the whale i will do my endeavor i try all things i achieve what i can  physiognomically regarded the sperm whale is an anomalous creature he has no proper nose and since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the features and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls their combined expression hence it would seem that its entire absence as an external appendage must very largely affect the countenance of the whale for as in landscape gardening a spire cupola monument or tower of some sort is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated open work belfry of the nose dash the nose from phidias s marble jove and what a sorry remainder nevertheless leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude all his proportions are so stately that the same deficiency which in the sculptured jove were hideous in him is no blemish at all nay it is an added grandeur a nose to the whale would have been impertinent as on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your jolly boat your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled a pestilent conceit which so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne  in some particulars perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to be had of the sperm whale is that of the full front of his head this aspect is sublime  in thought a fine human brow is like the east when troubled with the morning in the repose of the pasture the curled brow of the bull has a touch of the grand in it pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles the elephant s brow is majestic human or animal the mystical brow is as that great golden seal affixed by the german emperors to their decrees it signifies god done this day by my hand but in most creatures nay in man himself very often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line few are the foreheads which like shakespeare s or melancthon s rise so high and descend so low that the eyes themselves seem clear eternal tideless mountain lakes and all above them in the forehead s wrinkles you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending there to drink as the highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer but in the great sperm whale this high and mighty god like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified that gazing on it in that full front view you feel the deity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other object in living nature for you see no one point precisely not one distinct feature is revealed no nose eyes ears or mouth no face he has none proper nothing but that one broad firmament of a forehead pleated with riddles dumbly lowering with the doom of boats and ships and men nor in profile does this wondrous brow diminish though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so in profile you plainly perceive that horizontal semi crescentic depression in the forehead s middle which in man is lavater s mark of genius  but how genius in the sperm whale has the sperm whale ever written a book spoken a speech no his great genius is declared in his doing nothing particular to prove it it is moreover declared in his pyramidical silence and this reminds me that had the great sperm whale been known to the young orient world he would have been deified by their child magian thoughts they deified the crocodile of the nile because the crocodile is tongueless and the sperm whale has no tongue or at least it is so exceedingly small as to be incapable of protrusion if hereafter any highly cultured poetical nation shall lure back to their birth right the merry may day gods of old and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky in the now unhaunted hill then be sure exalted to jove s high seat the great sperm whale shall lord it  champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics but there is no champollion to decipher the egypt of every man s and every being s face physiognomy like every other human science is but a passing fable if then sir william jones who read in thirty languages could not read the simplest peasant s face in its profounder and more subtle meanings how may unlettered ishmael hope to read the awful chaldee of the sperm whale s brow i but put that brow before you read it if you can
