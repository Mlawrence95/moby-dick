chapter 81 the pequod meets the virgin  the predestinated day arrived and we duly met the ship jungfrau derick de deer master of bremen  at one time the greatest whaling people in the world the dutch and germans are now among the least but here and there at very wide intervals of latitude and longitude you still occasionally meet with their flag in the pacific  for some reason the jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects while yet some distance from the pequod she rounded to and dropping a boat her captain was impelled towards us impatiently standing in the bows instead of the stern  what has he in his hand there cried starbuck pointing to something wavingly held by the german impossible a lamp feeder  not that said stubb no no it s a coffee pot mr starbuck he s coming off to make us our coffee is the yarman don t you see that big tin can there alongside of him that s his boiling water oh he s all right is the yarman  go along with you cried flask it s a lamp feeder and an oil can he s out of oil and has come a begging  however curious it may seem for an oil ship to be borrowing oil on the whale ground and however much it may invertedly contradict the old proverb about carrying coals to newcastle yet sometimes such a thing really happens and in the present case captain derick de deer did indubitably conduct a lamp feeder as flask did declare  as he mounted the deck ahab abruptly accosted him without at all heeding what he had in his hand but in his broken lingo the german soon evinced his complete ignorance of the white whale immediately turning the conversation to his lamp feeder and oil can with some remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darkness his last drop of bremen oil being gone and not a single flying fish yet captured to supply the deficiency concluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the fishery is technically called a _clean_ one that is an empty one well deserving the name of jungfrau or the virgin  his necessities supplied derick departed but he had not gained his ship s side when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the mast heads of both vessels and so eager for the chase was derick that without pausing to put his oil can and lamp feeder aboard he slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp feeders  now the game having risen to leeward he and the other three german boats that soon followed him had considerably the start of the pequod s keels there were eight whales an average pod aware of their danger they were going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness they left a great wide wake as though continually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea  full in this rapid wake and many fathoms in the rear swam a huge humped old bull which by his comparatively slow progress as well as by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him seemed afflicted with the jaundice or some other infirmity whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance seemed questionable for it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social nevertheless he stuck to their wake though indeed their back water must have retarded him because the white bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet his spout was short slow and laborious coming forth with a choking sort of gush and spending itself in torn shreds followed by strange subterranean commotions in him which seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity causing the waters behind him to upbubble  who s got some paregoric said stubb he has the stomach ache i m afraid lord think of having half an acre of stomach ache adverse winds are holding mad christmas in him boys it s the first foul wind i ever knew to blow from astern but look did ever whale yaw so before it must be he s lost his tiller  as an overladen indiaman bearing down the hindostan coast with a deck load of frightened horses careens buries rolls and wallows on her way so did this old whale heave his aged bulk and now and then partly turning over on his cumbrous rib ends expose the cause of his devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin whether he had lost that fin in battle or had been born without it it were hard to say  only wait a bit old chap and i ll give ye a sling for that wounded arm cried cruel flask pointing to the whale line near him  mind he don t sling thee with it cried starbuck give way or the german will have him  with one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one fish because not only was he the largest and therefore the most valuable whale but he was nearest to them and the other whales were going with such great velocity moreover as almost to defy pursuit for the time at this juncture the pequod s keels had shot by the three german boats last lowered but from the great start he had had derick s boat still led the chase though every moment neared by his foreign rivals the only thing they feared was that from being already so nigh to his mark he would be enabled to dart his iron before they could completely overtake and pass him as for derick he seemed quite confident that this would be the case and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lamp feeder at the other boats  the ungracious and ungrateful dog cried starbuck he mocks and dares me with the very poor box i filled for him not five minutes ago then in his old intense whisper give way greyhounds dog to it  i tell ye what it is men cried stubb to his crew it s against my religion to get mad but i d like to eat that villainous yarman pull won t ye are ye going to let that rascal beat ye do ye love brandy a hogshead of brandy then to the best man come why don t some of ye burst a blood vessel who s that been dropping an anchor overboard we don t budge an inch we re becalmed halloo here s grass growing in the boat s bottom and by the lord the mast there s budding this won t do boys look at that yarman the short and long of it is men will ye spit fire or not  oh see the suds he makes cried flask dancing up and down what a hump oh _do_ pile on the beef lays like a log oh my lads _do_ spring slap jacks and quahogs for supper you know my lads baked clams and muffins oh _do_ _do_ spring he s a hundred barreller don t lose him now don t oh _don t _ see that yarman oh won t ye pull for your duff my lads such a sog such a sogger don t ye love sperm there goes three thousand dollars men a bank a whole bank the bank of england oh _do_ _do_ _do _ what s that yarman about now  at this moment derick was in the act of pitching his lamp feeder at the advancing boats and also his oil can perhaps with the double view of retarding his rivals way and at the same time economically accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss  the unmannerly dutch dogger cried stubb pull now men like fifty thousand line of battle ship loads of red haired devils what d ye say tashtego are you the man to snap your spine in two and twenty pieces for the honor of old gayhead what d ye say  i say pull like god dam cried the indian  fiercely but evenly incited by the taunts of the german the pequod s three boats now began ranging almost abreast and so disposed momentarily neared him in that fine loose chivalrous attitude of the headsman when drawing near to his prey the three mates stood up proudly occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry of there she slides now hurrah for the white ash breeze down with the yarman sail over him  but so decided an original start had derick had that spite of all their gallantry he would have proved the victor in this race had not a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of his midship oarsman while this clumsy lubber was striving to free his white ash and while in consequence derick s boat was nigh to capsizing and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage that was a good time for starbuck stubb and flask with a shout they took a mortal start forwards and slantingly ranged up on the german s quarter an instant more and all four boats were diagonically in the whale s immediate wake while stretching from them on both sides was the foaming swell that he made  it was a terrific most pitiable and maddening sight the whale was now going head out and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented jet while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright now to this hand now to that he yawed in his faltering flight and still at every billow that he broke he spasmodically sank in the sea or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin so have i seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles in the air vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks but the bird has a voice and with plaintive cries will make known her fear but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea was chained up and enchanted in him he had no voice save that choking respiration through his spiracle and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable while still in his amazing bulk portcullis jaw and omnipotent tail there was enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied  seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the pequod s boats the advantage and rather than be thus foiled of his game derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart ere the last chance would for ever escape  but no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke than all three tigers queequeg tashtego daggoo instinctively sprang to their feet and standing in a diagonal row simultaneously pointed their barbs and darted over the head of the german harpooneer their three nantucket irons entered the whale blinding vapors of foam and white fire the three boats in the first fury of the whale s headlong rush bumped the german s aside with such force that both derick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out and sailed over by the three flying keels  don t be afraid my butter boxes cried stubb casting a passing glance upon them as he shot by ye ll be picked up presently all right i saw some sharks astern st bernard s dogs you know relieve distressed travellers hurrah this is the way to sail now every keel a sunbeam hurrah here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a mad cougar this puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury on a plain makes the wheel spokes fly boys when you fasten to him that way and there s danger of being pitched out too when you strike a hill hurrah this is the way a fellow feels when he s going to davy jones all a rush down an endless inclined plane hurrah this whale carries the everlasting mail  but the monster s run was a brief one giving a sudden gasp he tumultuously sounded with a grating rush the three lines flew round the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust the lines that using all their dexterous might they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on till at last owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead lined chocks of the boats whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue the gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water while the three sterns tilted high in the air and the whale soon ceasing to sound for some time they remained in that attitude fearful of expending more line though the position was a little ticklish but though boats have been taken down and lost in this way yet it is this holding on as it is called this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from the back this it is that often torments the leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his foes yet not to speak of the peril of the thing it is to be doubted whether this course is always the best for it is but reasonable to presume that the longer the stricken whale stays under water the more he is exhausted because owing to the enormous surface of him in a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000 square feet the pressure of the water is immense we all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under even here above ground in the air how vast then the burden of a whale bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean it must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres one whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty line of battle ships with all their guns and stores and men on board  as the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea gazing down into its eternal blue noon and as not a single groan or cry of any sort nay not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths what landsman would have thought that beneath all that silence and placidity the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in agony not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock suspended and to what to three bits of board is this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons or his head with fish spears the sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold the spear the dart nor the habergeon he esteemeth iron as straw the arrow cannot make him flee darts are counted as stubble he laugheth at the shaking of a spear this the creature this he oh that unfulfilments should follow the prophets for with the strength of a thousand thighs in his tail leviathan had run his head under the mountains of the sea to hide him from the pequod s fish spears  in that sloping afternoon sunlight the shadows that the three boats sent down beneath the surface must have been long enough and broad enough to shade half xerxes army who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head  stand by men he stirs cried starbuck as the three lines suddenly vibrated in the water distinctly conducting upwards to them as by magnetic wires the life and death throbs of the whale so that every oarsman felt them in his seat the next moment relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows the boats gave a sudden bounce upwards as a small icefield will when a dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea  haul in haul in cried starbuck again he s rising  the lines of which hardly an instant before not one hand s breadth could have been gained were now in long quick coils flung back all dripping into the boats and soon the whale broke water within two ship s lengths of the hunters  his motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion in most land animals there are certain valves or flood gates in many of their veins whereby when wounded the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in certain directions not so with the whale one of whose peculiarities it is to have an entire non valvular structure of the blood vessels so that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him and so distant and numerous its interior fountains that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period even as in a drought a river will flow whose source is in the well springs of far off and undiscernible hills even now when the boats pulled upon this whale and perilously drew over his swaying flukes and the lances were darted into him they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound which kept continually playing while the natural spout hole in his head was only at intervals however rapid sending its affrighted moisture into the air from this last vent no blood yet came because no vital part of him had thus far been struck his life as they significantly call it was untouched  as the boats now more closely surrounded him the whole upper part of his form with much of it that is ordinarily submerged was plainly revealed his eyes or rather the places where his eyes had been were beheld as strange misgrown masses gather in the knot holes of the noblest oaks when prostrate so from the points which the whale s eyes had once occupied now protruded blind bulbs horribly pitiable to see but pity there was none for all his old age and his one arm and his blind eyes he must die the death and be murdered in order to light the gay bridals and other merry makings of men and also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all still rolling in his blood at last he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance the size of a bushel low down on the flank  a nice spot cried flask just let me prick him there once  avast cried starbuck there s no need of that  but humane starbuck was too late at the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound and goaded by it into more than sufferable anguish the whale now spouting thick blood with swift fury blindly darted at the craft bespattering them and their glorying crews all over with showers of gore capsizing flask s boat and marring the bows it was his death stroke for by this time so spent was he by loss of blood that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made lay panting on his side impotently flapped with his stumped fin then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world turned up the white secrets of his belly lay like a log and died it was most piteous that last expiring spout as when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain and with half stifled melancholy gurglings the spray column lowers and lowers to the ground so the last long dying spout of the whale  soon while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship the body showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled immediately by starbuck s orders lines were secured to it at different points so that ere long every boat was a buoy the sunken whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords by very heedful management when the ship drew nigh the whale was transferred to her side and was strongly secured there by the stiffest fluke chains for it was plain that unless artificially upheld the body would at once sink to the bottom  it so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh on the lower part of the bunch before described but as the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales with the flesh perfectly healed around them and no prominence of any kind to denote their place therefore there must needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to but still more curious was the fact of a lance head of stone being found in him not far from the buried iron the flesh perfectly firm about it who had darted that stone lance and when it might have been darted by some nor west indian long before america was discovered  what other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet there is no telling but a sudden stop was put to further discoveries by the ship s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea owing to the body s immensely increasing tendency to sink however starbuck who had the ordering of affairs hung on to it to the last hung on to it so resolutely indeed that when at length the ship would have been capsized if still persisting in locking arms with the body then when the command was given to break clear from it such was the immovable strain upon the timber heads to which the fluke chains and cables were fastened that it was impossible to cast them off meantime everything in the pequod was aslant to cross to the other side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house the ship groaned and gasped many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from their places by the unnatural dislocation in vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable fluke chains to pry them adrift from the timberheads and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all approached while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk and the ship seemed on the point of going over  hold on hold on won t ye cried stubb to the body don t be in such a devil of a hurry to sink by thunder men we must do something or go for it no use prying there avast i say with your handspikes and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen knife and cut the big chains  knife aye aye cried queequeg and seizing the carpenter s heavy hatchet he leaned out of a porthole and steel to iron began slashing at the largest fluke chains but a few strokes full of sparks were given when the exceeding strain effected the rest with a terrific snap every fastening went adrift the ship righted the carcase sank  now this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed sperm whale is a very curious thing nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it usually the dead sperm whale floats with great buoyancy with its side or belly considerably elevated above the surface if the only whales that thus sank were old meagre and broken hearted creatures their pads of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic then you might with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him but it is not so for young whales in the highest health and swelling with noble aspirations prematurely cut off in the warm flush and may of life with all their panting lard about them even these brawny buoyant heroes do sometimes sink  be it said however that the sperm whale is far less liable to this accident than any other species where one of that sort go down twenty right whales do this difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the right whale his venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton from this incumbrance the sperm whale is wholly free but there are instances where after the lapse of many hours or several days the sunken whale again rises more buoyant than in life but the reason of this is obvious gases are generated in him he swells to a prodigious magnitude becomes a sort of animal balloon a line of battle ship could hardly keep him under then in the shore whaling on soundings among the bays of new zealand when a right whale gives token of sinking they fasten buoys to him with plenty of rope so that when the body has gone down they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again  it was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from the pequod s mast heads announcing that the jungfrau was again lowering her boats though the only spout in sight was that of a fin back belonging to the species of uncapturable whales because of its incredible power of swimming nevertheless the fin back s spout is so similar to the sperm whale s that by unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it and consequently derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute the virgin crowding all sail made after her four young keels and thus they all disappeared far to leeward still in bold hopeful chase  oh many are the fin backs and many are the dericks my friend
