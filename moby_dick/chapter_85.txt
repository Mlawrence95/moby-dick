chapter 82 the honor and glory of whaling  there are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true method  the more i dive into this matter of whaling and push my researches up to the very spring head of it so much the more am i impressed with its great honorableness and antiquity and especially when i find so many great demi gods and heroes prophets of all sorts who one way or other have shed distinction upon it i am transported with the reflection that i myself belong though but subordinately to so emblazoned a fraternity  the gallant perseus a son of jupiter was the first whaleman and to the eternal honor of our calling be it said that the first whale attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent those were the knightly days of our profession when we only bore arms to succor the distressed and not to fill men s lamp feeders every one knows the fine story of perseus and andromeda how the lovely andromeda the daughter of a king was tied to a rock on the sea coast and as leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off perseus the prince of whalemen intrepidly advancing harpooned the monster and delivered and married the maid it was an admirable artistic exploit rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day inasmuch as this leviathan was slain at the very first dart and let no man doubt this arkite story for in the ancient joppa now jaffa on the syrian coast in one of the pagan temples there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale which the city s legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that perseus slew when the romans took joppa the same skeleton was carried to italy in triumph what seems most singular and suggestively important in this story is this it was from joppa that jonah set sail  akin to the adventure of perseus and andromeda indeed by some supposed to be indirectly derived from it is that famous story of st george and the dragon which dragon i maintain to have been a whale for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together and often stand for each other thou art as a lion of the waters and as a dragon of the sea saith ezekiel hereby plainly meaning a whale in truth some versions of the bible use that word itself besides it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had st george but encountered a crawling reptile of the land instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep any man may kill a snake but only a perseus a st george a coffin have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale  let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us for though the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely represented of a griffin like shape and though the battle is depicted on land and the saint on horseback yet considering the great ignorance of those times when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists and considering that as in perseus case st george s whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach and considering that the animal ridden by st george might have been only a large seal or sea horse bearing all this in mind it will not appear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene to hold this so called dragon no other than the great leviathan himself in fact placed before the strict and piercing truth this whole story will fare like that fish flesh and fowl idol of the philistines dagon by name who being planted before the ark of israel his horse s head and both the palms of his hands fell off from him and only the stump or fishy part of him remained thus then one of our own noble stamp even a whaleman is the tutelary guardian of england and by good rights we harpooneers of nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of st george and therefore let not the knights of that honorable company none of whom i venture to say have ever had to do with a whale like their great patron let them never eye a nantucketer with disdain since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled to st george s decoration than they  whether to admit hercules among us or not concerning this i long remained dubious for though according to the greek mythologies that antique crockett and kit carson that brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale still whether that strictly makes a whaleman of him that might be mooted it nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish unless indeed from the inside nevertheless he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman at any rate the whale caught him if he did not the whale i claim him for one of our clan  but by the best contradictory authorities this grecian story of hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient hebrew story of jonah and the whale and vice vers√¢ certainly they are very similar if i claim the demi god then why not the prophet  nor do heroes saints demigods and prophets alone comprise the whole roll of our order our grand master is still to be named for like royal kings of old times we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves that wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the shaster which gives us the dread vishnoo one of the three persons in the godhead of the hindoos gives us this divine vishnoo himself for our lord vishnoo who by the first of his ten earthly incarnations has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale when brahma or the god of gods saith the shaster resolved to recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions he gave birth to vishnoo to preside over the work but the vedas or mystical books whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to vishnoo before beginning the creation and which therefore must have contained something in the shape of practical hints to young architects these vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters so vishnoo became incarnate in a whale and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths rescued the sacred volumes was not this vishnoo a whaleman then even as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman  perseus st george hercules jonah and vishnoo there s a member roll for you what club but the whaleman s can head off like that
