chapter 84 pitchpoling  to make them run easily and swiftly the axles of carriages are anointed and for much the same purpose some whalers perform an analogous operation upon their boat they grease the bottom nor is it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage considering that oil and water are hostile that oil is a sliding thing and that the object in view is to make the boat slide bravely queequeg believed strongly in anointing his boat and one morning not long after the german ship jungfrau disappeared took more than customary pains in that occupation crawling under its bottom where it hung over the side and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from the craft s bald keel he seemed to be working in obedience to some particular presentiment nor did it remain unwarranted by the event  towards noon whales were raised but so soon as the ship sailed down to them they turned and fled with swift precipitancy a disordered flight as of cleopatra s barges from actium  nevertheless the boats pursued and stubb s was foremost by great exertion tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron but the stricken whale without at all sounding still continued his horizontal flight with added fleetness such unintermitted strainings upon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it it became imperative to lance the flying whale or be content to lose him but to haul the boat up to his flank was impossible he swam so fast and furious what then remained  of all the wondrous devices and dexterities the sleights of hand and countless subtleties to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced none exceed that fine man≈ìuvre with the lance called pitchpoling small sword or broad sword in all its exercises boasts nothing like it it is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently rocking jerking boat under extreme headway steel and wood included the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in length the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon and also of a lighter material pine it is furnished with a small rope called a warp of considerable length by which it can be hauled back to the hand after darting  but before going further it is important to mention here that though the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance yet it is seldom done and when done is still less frequently successful on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the lance which in effect become serious drawbacks as a general thing therefore you must first get fast to a whale before any pitchpoling comes into play  look now at stubb a man who from his humorous deliberate coolness and equanimity in the direst emergencies was specially qualified to excel in pitchpoling look at him he stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat wrapt in fleecy foam the towing whale is forty feet ahead handling the long lance lightly glancing twice or thrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand so as to secure its free end in his grasp leaving the rest unobstructed then holding the lance full before his waistband s middle he levels it at the whale when covering him with it he steadily depresses the butt end in his hand thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his palm fifteen feet in the air he minds you somewhat of a juggler balancing a long staff on his chin next moment with a rapid nameless impulse in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming distance and quivers in the life spot of the whale instead of sparkling water he now spouts red blood  that drove the spigot out of him cried stubb tis july s immortal fourth all fountains must run wine today would now it were old orleans whiskey or old ohio or unspeakable old monongahela then tashtego lad i d have ye hold a canakin to the jet and we d drink round it yea verily hearts alive we d brew choice punch in the spread of his spout hole there and from that live punch bowl quaff the living stuff  again and again to such gamesome talk the dexterous dart is repeated the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful leash the agonized whale goes into his flurry the tow line is slackened and the pitchpoler dropping astern folds his hands and mutely watches the monster die
