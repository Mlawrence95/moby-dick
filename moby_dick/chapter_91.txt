chapter 88 schools and schoolmasters  the previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of sperm whales and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those vast aggregations  now though such great bodies are at times encountered yet as must have been seen even at the present day small detached bands are occasionally observed embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each such bands are known as schools they generally are of two sorts those composed almost entirely of females and those mustering none but young vigorous males or bulls as they are familiarly designated  in cavalier attendance upon the school of females you invariably see a male of full grown magnitude but not old who upon any alarm evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his ladies in truth this gentleman is a luxurious ottoman swimming about over the watery world surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and endearments of the harem the contrast between this ottoman and his concubines is striking because while he is always of the largest leviathanic proportions the ladies even at full growth are not more than one third of the bulk of an average sized male they are comparatively delicate indeed i dare say not to exceed half a dozen yards round the waist nevertheless it cannot be denied that upon the whole they are hereditarily entitled to _en bon point_  it is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent ramblings like fashionables they are for ever on the move in leisurely search of variety you meet them on the line in time for the full flower of the equatorial feeding season having just returned perhaps from spending the summer in the northern seas and so cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth by the time they have lounged up and down the promenade of the equator awhile they start for the oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there and so evade the other excessive temperature of the year  when serenely advancing on one of these journeys if any strange suspicious sights are seen my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his interesting family should any unwarrantably pert young leviathan coming that way presume to draw confidentially close to one of the ladies with what prodigious fury the bashaw assails him and chases him away high times indeed if unprincipled young rakes like him are to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss though do what the bashaw will he cannot keep the most notorious lothario out of his bed for alas all fish bed in common as ashore the ladies often cause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers just so with the whales who sometimes come to deadly battle and all for love they fence with their long lower jaws sometimes locking them together and so striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their antlers not a few are captured having the deep scars of these encounters furrowed heads broken teeth scolloped fins and in some instances wrenched and dislocated mouths  but supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at the first rush of the harem s lord then is it very diverting to watch that lord gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and revels there awhile still in tantalizing vicinity to young lothario like pious solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines granting other whales to be in sight the fishermen will seldom give chase to one of these grand turks for these grand turks are too lavish of their strength and hence their unctuousness is small as for the sons and the daughters they beget why those sons and daughters must take care of themselves at least with only the maternal help for like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named my lord whale has no taste for the nursery however much for the bower and so being a great traveller he leaves his anonymous babies all over the world every baby an exotic in good time nevertheless as the ardour of youth declines as years and dumps increase as reflection lends her solemn pauses in short as a general lassitude overtakes the sated turk then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for maidens our ottoman enters upon the impotent repentant admonitory stage of life forswears disbands the harem and grown to an exemplary sulky old soul goes about all alone among the meridians and parallels saying his prayers and warning each young leviathan from his amorous errors  now as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school so is the lord and master of that school technically known as the schoolmaster it is therefore not in strict character however admirably satirical that after going to school himself he should then go abroad inculcating not what he learned there but the folly of it his title schoolmaster would very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed upon the harem itself but some have surmised that the man who first thus entitled this sort of ottoman whale must have read the memoirs of vidocq and informed himself what sort of a country schoolmaster that famous frenchman was in his younger days and what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into some of his pupils  the same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale betakes himself in his advancing years is true of all aged sperm whales almost universally a lone whale as a solitary leviathan is called proves an ancient one like venerable moss bearded daniel boone he will have no one near him but nature herself and her he takes to wife in the wilderness of waters and the best of wives she is though she keeps so many moody secrets  the schools composing none but young and vigorous males previously mentioned offer a strong contrast to the harem schools for while those female whales are characteristically timid the young males or forty barrel bulls as they call them are by far the most pugnacious of all leviathans and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter excepting those wondrous grey headed grizzled whales sometimes met and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout  the forty barrel bull schools are larger than the harem schools like a mob of young collegians they are full of fight fun and wickedness tumbling round the world at such a reckless rollicking rate that no prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous lad at yale or harvard they soon relinquish this turbulence though and when about three fourths grown break up and separately go about in quest of settlements that is harems  another point of difference between the male and female schools is still more characteristic of the sexes say you strike a forty barrel bull poor devil all his comrades quit him but strike a member of the harem school and her companions swim around her with every token of concern sometimes lingering so near her and so long as themselves to fall a prey
