chapter 91 the pequod meets the rose bud  in vain it was to rake for ambergriese in the paunch of this leviathan insufferable fetor denying not inquiry _sir t browne v e _  it was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted and when we were slowly sailing over a sleepy vapory mid day sea that the many noses on the pequod s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the three pairs of eyes aloft a peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in the sea  i will bet something now said stubb that somewhere hereabouts are some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day i thought they would keel up before long  presently the vapors in advance slid aside and there in the distance lay a ship whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside as we glided nearer the stranger showed french colours from his peak and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea fowl that circled and hovered and swooped around him it was plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale that is a whale that has died unmolested on the sea and so floated an unappropriated corpse it may well be conceived what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale worse than an assyrian city in the plague when the living are incompetent to bury the departed so intolerable indeed is it regarded by some that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it yet are there those who will still do it notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality and by no means of the nature of attar of rose  coming still nearer with the expiring breeze we saw that the frenchman had a second whale alongside and this second whale seemed even more of a nosegay than the first in truth it turned out to be one of those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia or indigestion leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil nevertheless in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this however much he may shun blasted whales in general  the pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger that stubb vowed he recognised his cutting spade pole entangled in the lines that were knotted round the tail of one of these whales  there s a pretty fellow now he banteringly laughed standing in the ship s bows there s a jackal for ye i well know that these crappoes of frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery sometimes lowering their boats for breakers mistaking them for sperm whale spouts yes and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow candles and cases of snuffers foreseeing that all the oil they will get won t be enough to dip the captain s wick into aye we all know these things but look ye here s a crappo that is content with our leavings the drugged whale there i mean aye and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there poor devil i say pass round a hat some one and let s make him a present of a little oil for dear charity s sake for what oil he ll get from that drugged whale there wouldn t be fit to burn in a jail no not in a condemned cell and as for the other whale why i ll agree to get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours than he ll get from that bundle of bones though now that i think of it it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil yes ambergris i wonder now if our old man has thought of that it s worth trying yes i m for it and so saying he started for the quarter deck  by this time the faint air had become a complete calm so that whether or no the pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell with no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again issuing from the cabin stubb now called his boat s crew and pulled off for the stranger drawing across her bow he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful french taste the upper part of her stem piece was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk was painted green and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour upon her head boards in large gilt letters he read bouton de rose rose button or rose bud and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship  though stubb did not understand the _bouton_ part of the inscription yet the word _rose_ and the bulbous figure head put together sufficiently explained the whole to him  a wooden rose bud eh he cried with his hand to his nose that will do very well but how like all creation it smells  now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck he had to pull round the bows to the starboard side and thus come close to the blasted whale and so talk over it  arrived then at this spot with one hand still to his nose he bawled bouton de rose ahoy are there any of you bouton de roses that speak english  yes rejoined a guernsey man from the bulwarks who turned out to be the chief mate  well then my bouton de rose bud have you seen the white whale  _what_ whale  the _white_ whale a sperm whale moby dick have ye seen him  never heard of such a whale cachalot blanche white whale no  very good then good bye now and i ll call again in a minute  then rapidly pulling back towards the pequod and seeing ahab leaning over the quarter deck rail awaiting his report he moulded his two hands into a trumpet and shouted no sir no upon which ahab retired and stubb returned to the frenchman  he now perceived that the guernsey man who had just got into the chains and was using a cutting spade had slung his nose in a sort of bag  what s the matter with your nose there said stubb broke it  i wish it was broken or that i didn t have any nose at all answered the guernsey man who did not seem to relish the job he was at very much but what are you holding _yours_ for  oh nothing it s a wax nose i have to hold it on fine day ain t it air rather gardenny i should say throw us a bunch of posies will ye bouton de rose  what in the devil s name do you want here roared the guernseyman flying into a sudden passion  oh keep cool cool yes that s the word why don t you pack those whales in ice while you re working at em but joking aside though do you know rose bud that it s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales as for that dried up one there he hasn t a gill in his whole carcase  i know that well enough but d ye see the captain here won t believe it this is his first voyage he was a cologne manufacturer before but come aboard and mayhap he ll believe you if he won t me and so i ll get out of this dirty scrape  anything to oblige ye my sweet and pleasant fellow rejoined stubb and with that he soon mounted to the deck there a queer scene presented itself the sailors in tasselled caps of red worsted were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales but they worked rather slow and talked very fast and seemed in anything but a good humor all their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many jib booms now and then pairs of them would drop their work and run up to the mast head to get some fresh air some thinking they would catch the plague dipped oakum in coal tar and at intervals held it to their nostrils others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl were vigorously puffing tobacco smoke so that it constantly filled their olfactories  stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the captain s round house abaft and looking in that direction saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door which was held ajar from within this was the tormented surgeon who after in vain remonstrating against the proceedings of the day had betaken himself to the captain s round house _cabinet_ he called it to avoid the pest but still could not help yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times  marking all this stubb argued well for his scheme and turning to the guernsey man had a little chat with him during which the stranger mate expressed his detestation of his captain as a conceited ignoramus who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle sounding him carefully stubb further perceived that the guernsey man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris he therefore held his peace on that head but otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him so that the two quickly concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the captain without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity according to this little plan of theirs the guernsey man under cover of an interpreter s office was to tell the captain what he pleased but as coming from stubb and as for stubb he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview  by this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin he was a small and dark but rather delicate looking man for a sea captain with large whiskers and moustache however and wore a red cotton velvet vest with watch seals at his side to this gentleman stubb was now politely introduced by the guernsey man who at once ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them  what shall i say to him first said he  why said stubb eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me though i don t pretend to be a judge  he says monsieur said the guernsey man in french turning to his captain that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel whose captain and chief mate with six sailors had all died of a fever caught from a blasted whale they had brought alongside  upon this the captain started and eagerly desired to know more  what now said the guernsey man to stubb  why since he takes it so easy tell him that now i have eyed him carefully i m quite certain that he s no more fit to command a whale ship than a st jago monkey in fact tell him from me he s a baboon  he vows and declares monsieur that the other whale the dried one is far more deadly than the blasted one in fine monsieur he conjures us as we value our lives to cut loose from these fish  instantly the captain ran forward and in a loud voice commanded his crew to desist from hoisting the cutting tackles and at once cast loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship  what now said the guernsey man when the captain had returned to them  why let me see yes you may as well tell him now that that in fact tell him i ve diddled him and aside to himself perhaps somebody else  he says monsieur that he s very happy to have been of any service to us  hearing this the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties meaning himself and mate and concluded by inviting stubb down into his cabin to drink a bottle of bordeaux  he wants you to take a glass of wine with him said the interpreter  thank him heartily but tell him it s against my principles to drink with the man i ve diddled in fact tell him i must go  he says monsieur that his principles won t admit of his drinking but that if monsieur wants to live another day to drink then monsieur had best drop all four boats and pull the ship away from these whales for it s so calm they won t drift  by this time stubb was over the side and getting into his boat hailed the guernsey man to this effect that having a long tow line in his boat he would do what he could to help them by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the ship s side while the frenchman s boats then were engaged in towing the ship one way stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow line  presently a breeze sprang up stubb feigned to cast off from the whale hoisting his boats the frenchman soon increased his distance while the pequod slid in between him and stubb s whale whereupon stubb quickly pulled to the floating body and hailing the pequod to give notice of his intentions at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning seizing his sharp boat spade he commenced an excavation in the body a little behind the side fin you would almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea and when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs it was like turning up old roman tiles and pottery buried in fat english loam his boat s crew were all in high excitement eagerly helping their chief and looking as anxious as gold hunters  and all the time numberless fowls were diving and ducking and screaming and yelling and fighting around them stubb was beginning to look disappointed especially as the horrible nosegay increased when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague there stole a faint stream of perfume which flowed through the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it as one river will flow into and then along with another without at all blending with it for a time  i have it i have it cried stubb with delight striking something in the subterranean regions a purse a purse  dropping his spade he thrust both hands in and drew out handfuls of something that looked like ripe windsor soap or rich mottled old cheese very unctuous and savory withal you might easily dent it with your thumb it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour and this good friends is ambergris worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist some six handfuls were obtained but more was unavoidably lost in the sea and still more perhaps might have been secured were it not for impatient ahab s loud command to stubb to desist and come on board else the ship would bid them good bye
