chapter 93 the castaway  it was but some few days after encountering the frenchman that a most significant event befell the most insignificant of the pequod s crew an event most lamentable and which ended in providing the sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own  now in the whale ship it is not every one that goes in the boats some few hands are reserved called ship keepers whose province it is to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale as a general thing these ship keepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats crews but if there happen to be an unduly slender clumsy or timorous wight in the ship that wight is certain to be made a ship keeper it was so in the pequod with the little negro pippin by nick name pip by abbreviation poor pip ye have heard of him before ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight so gloomy jolly  in outer aspect pip and dough boy made a match like a black pony and a white one of equal developments though of dissimilar colour driven in one eccentric span but while hapless dough boy was by nature dull and torpid in his intellects pip though over tender hearted was at bottom very bright with that pleasant genial jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe a tribe which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer freer relish than any other race for blacks the year s calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty five fourth of julys and new year s days nor smile so while i write that this little black was brilliant for even blackness has its brilliancy behold yon lustrous ebony panelled in king s cabinets but pip loved life and all life s peaceable securities so that the panic striking business in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped had most sadly blurred his brightness though as ere long will be seen what was thus temporarily subdued in him in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange wild fires that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native tolland county in connecticut he had once enlivened many a fiddler s frolic on the green and at melodious even tide with his gay ha ha had turned the round horizon into one star belled tambourine so though in the clear air of day suspended against a blue veined neck the pure watered diamond drop will healthful glow yet when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre he lays it against a gloomy ground and then lights it up not by the sun but by some unnatural gases then come out those fiery effulgences infernally superb then the evil blazing diamond once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies looks like some crown jewel stolen from the king of hell but let us to the story  it came to pass that in the ambergris affair stubb s after oarsman chanced so to sprain his hand as for a time to become quite maimed and temporarily pip was put into his place  the first time stubb lowered with him pip evinced much nervousness but happily for that time escaped close contact with the whale and therefore came off not altogether discreditably though stubb observing him took care afterwards to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost for he might often find it needful  now upon the second lowering the boat paddled upon the whale and as the fish received the darted iron it gave its customary rap which happened in this instance to be right under poor pip s seat the involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap paddle in hand out of the boat and in such a way that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest he breasted it overboard with him so as to become entangled in it when at last plumping into the water that instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run the line swiftly straightened and presto poor pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat remorselessly dragged there by the line which had taken several turns around his chest and neck  tashtego stood in the bows he was full of the fire of the hunt he hated pip for a poltroon snatching the boat knife from its sheath he suspended its sharp edge over the line and turning towards stubb exclaimed interrogatively cut meantime pip s blue choked face plainly looked do for god s sake all passed in a flash in less than half a minute this entire thing happened  damn him cut roared stubb and so the whale was lost and pip was saved  so soon as he recovered himself the poor little negro was assailed by yells and execrations from the crew tranquilly permitting these irregular cursings to evaporate stubb then in a plain business like but still half humorous manner cursed pip officially and that done unofficially gave him much wholesome advice the substance was never jump from a boat pip except but all the rest was indefinite as the soundest advice ever is now in general _stick to the boat_ is your true motto in whaling but cases will sometimes happen when _leap from the boat_ is still better moreover as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted conscientious advice to pip he would be leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future stubb suddenly dropped all advice and concluded with a peremptory command stick to the boat pip or by the lord i won t pick you up if you jump mind that we can t afford to lose whales by the likes of you a whale would sell for thirty times what you would pip in alabama bear that in mind and don t jump any more hereby perhaps stubb indirectly hinted that though man loved his fellow yet man is a money making animal which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence  but we are all in the hands of the gods and pip jumped again it was under very similar circumstances to the first performance but this time he did not breast out the line and hence when the whale started to run pip was left behind on the sea like a hurried traveller s trunk alas stubb was but too true to his word it was a beautiful bounteous blue day the spangled sea calm and cool and flatly stretching away all round to the horizon like gold beater s skin hammered out to the extremest bobbing up and down in that sea pip s ebon head showed like a head of cloves no boat knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern stubb s inexorable back was turned upon him and the whale was winged in three minutes a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between pip and stubb out from the centre of the sea poor pip turned his crisp curling black head to the sun another lonely castaway though the loftiest and the brightest  now in calm weather to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the practised swimmer as to ride in a spring carriage ashore but the awful lonesomeness is intolerable the intense concentration of self in the middle of such a heartless immensity my god who can tell it mark how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea mark how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides  but had stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate no he did not mean to at least because there were two boats in his wake and he supposed no doubt that they would of course come up to pip very quickly and pick him up though indeed such considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar instances and such instances not unfrequently occur almost invariably in the fishery a coward so called is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies  but it so happened that those boats without seeing pip suddenly spying whales close to them on one side turned and gave chase and stubb s boat was now so far away and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish that pip s ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably by the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot such at least they said he was the sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up but drowned the infinite of his soul not drowned entirely though rather carried down alive to wondrous depths where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes and the miser merman wisdom revealed his hoarded heaps and among the joyous heartless ever juvenile eternities pip saw the multitudinous god omnipresent coral insects that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs he saw god s foot upon the treadle of the loom and spoke it and therefore his shipmates called him mad so man s insanity is heaven s sense and wandering from all mortal reason man comes at last to that celestial thought which to reason is absurd and frantic and weal or woe feels then uncompromised indifferent as his god  for the rest blame not stubb too hardly the thing is common in that fishery and in the sequel of the narrative it will then be seen what like abandonment befell myself
