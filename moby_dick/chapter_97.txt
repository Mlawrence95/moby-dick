chapter 94 a squeeze of the hand  that whale of stubb s so dearly purchased was duly brought to the pequod s side where all those cutting and hoisting operations previously detailed were regularly gone through even to the baling of the heidelburgh tun or case  while some were occupied with this latter duty others were employed in dragging away the larger tubs so soon as filled with the sperm and when the proper time arrived this same sperm was carefully manipulated ere going to the try works of which anon  it had cooled and crystallized to such a degree that when with several others i sat down before a large constantine s bath of it i found it strangely concreted into lumps here and there rolling about in the liquid part it was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid a sweet and unctuous duty no wonder that in old times this sperm was such a favourite cosmetic such a clearer such a sweetener such a softener such a delicious molifier after having my hands in it for only a few minutes my fingers felt like eels and began as it were to serpentine and spiralise  as i sat there at my ease cross legged on the deck after the bitter exertion at the windlass under a blue tranquil sky the ship under indolent sail and gliding so serenely along as i bathed my hands among those soft gentle globules of infiltrated tissues woven almost within the hour as they richly broke to my fingers and discharged all their opulence like fully ripe grapes their wine as i snuffed up that uncontaminated aroma literally and truly like the smell of spring violets i declare to you that for the time i lived as in a musky meadow i forgot all about our horrible oath in that inexpressible sperm i washed my hands and my heart of it i almost began to credit the old paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying the heat of anger while bathing in that bath i felt divinely free from all ill will or petulance or malice of any sort whatsoever  squeeze squeeze squeeze all the morning long i squeezed that sperm till i myself almost melted into it i squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me and i found myself unwittingly squeezing my co laborers hands in it mistaking their hands for the gentle globules such an abounding affectionate friendly loving feeling did this avocation beget that at last i was continually squeezing their hands and looking up into their eyes sentimentally as much as to say oh my dear fellow beings why should we longer cherish any social acerbities or know the slightest ill humor or envy come let us squeeze hands all round nay let us all squeeze ourselves into each other let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness  would that i could keep squeezing that sperm for ever for now since by many prolonged repeated experiences i have perceived that in all cases man must eventually lower or at least shift his conceit of attainable felicity not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy but in the wife the heart the bed the table the saddle the fireside the country now that i have perceived all this i am ready to squeeze case eternally in thoughts of the visions of the night i saw long rows of angels in paradise each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti  now while discoursing of sperm it behooves to speak of other things akin to it in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the try works  first comes white horse so called which is obtained from the tapering part of the fish and also from the thicker portions of his flukes it is tough with congealed tendons a wad of muscle but still contains some oil after being severed from the whale the white horse is first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer they look much like blocks of berkshire marble  plum pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the whale s flesh here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber and often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness it is a most refreshing convivial beautiful object to behold as its name imports it is of an exceedingly rich mottled tint with a bestreaked snowy and golden ground dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and purple it is plums of rubies in pictures of citron spite of reason it is hard to keep yourself from eating it i confess that once i stole behind the foremast to try it it tasted something as i should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of louis le gros might have tasted supposing him to have been killed the first day after the venison season and that particular venison season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the vineyards of champagne  there is another substance and a very singular one which turns up in the course of this business but which i feel it to be very puzzling adequately to describe it is called slobgollion an appellation original with the whalemen and even so is the nature of the substance it is an ineffably oozy stringy affair most frequently found in the tubs of sperm after a prolonged squeezing and subsequent decanting i hold it to be the wondrously thin ruptured membranes of the case coalescing  gurry so called is a term properly belonging to right whalemen but sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen it designates the dark glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the greenland or right whale and much of which covers the decks of those inferior souls who hunt that ignoble leviathan  nippers strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale s vocabulary but as applied by whalemen it becomes so a whaleman s nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of leviathan s tail it averages an inch in thickness and for the rest is about the size of the iron part of a hoe edgewise moved along the oily deck it operates like a leathern squilgee and by nameless blandishments as of magic allures along with it all impurities  but to learn all about these recondite matters your best way is at once to descend into the blubber room and have a long talk with its inmates this place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the blanket pieces when stript and hoisted from the whale when the proper time arrives for cutting up its contents this apartment is a scene of terror to all tyros especially by night on one side lit by a dull lantern a space has been left clear for the workmen they generally go in pairs a pike and gaffman and a spade man the whaling pike is similar to a frigate s boarding weapon of the same name the gaff is something like a boat hook with his gaff the gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber and strives to hold it from slipping as the ship pitches and lurches about meanwhile the spade man stands on the sheet itself perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horse pieces this spade is sharp as hone can make it the spademan s feet are shoeless the thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from him like a sledge if he cuts off one of his own toes or one of his assistants would you be very much astonished toes are scarce among veteran blubber room men
